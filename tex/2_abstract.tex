% (1) motivation/problem/task definition, 

Digital credential wallets manage identity documents such as government IDs and financial certificates, face the trilemma of privacy, security, and usability. Optimizing for anonymity by using Anonymous Credentials enhances privacy, but introduces challenges. Current benchmarks show verification using zero-knowledge proofs taking 50–500ms, far exceeding the <1ms of standard credentials, impeding usability. Additionally, anonymity complicates security: preventing multiple-credential issuance (sybil resistance) or enforcing revocation becomes difficult when both users and objects are essentially secret. These issues are urgent due to the EU’s 2026 mandate for EU-wide credential wallet usage, which will drive widespread adoption of digital credential wallets, while critical use cases, like privately combining credentials from multiple issuers for KYC, emphasize the importance of this work.

% (2) proposed method or idea, & main results
This thesis extends existing work and develops new, fast cryptographic primitives for privacy-preserving credential wallets. It introduces \emph{the fastest} anonymous credential scheme with a 5.37ms Show+Verify time for 30 attributes, outperforming prior methods by 10-15\%. Three extensions enhance this scheme. 1) formalized Identity Binding property for secure multi-issuer, multi-credential verification, with an implementation verifying 16 credentials from unique issuers in 72ms; 2) new nullifier constructions using $\Sigma$-protocols without pairings, improving privacy-preserving sybil resistance by 5x over previous approaches; 3) T-SIRIS, a threshold-issued, sybil-resistant identity system with near-constant Show+Verify times, over 30x faster than comparable systems \cite{rabaninejad_attribute-based_2024}.
These advancements are validated by an open-source Rust benchmarking library, delivering standardized empirical data across anonymous credential schemes.

% (4) broader impact or significance.
A fast, feature-rich digital credential wallet using anonymous credentials benefits users and organizations. Users gain control of their data, enhancing privacy and reducing personal information exposure. Organizations, especially in banking and finance, can reduce application abandonment from slow or invasive verification. Verification times under 100ms—5.37ms for single credentials and 72ms for 16 simultaneously—make these primitives practical for real-world deployment without hindering user experience. This efficiency suits KYC/AML, age verification, and digital identity applications where speed and privacy are critical.
