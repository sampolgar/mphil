\chapterstar{Acknowledgements}
I thank my supervisor, A/Prof Qiang Tang, for accepting me as a student and for his invaluable guidance whenever my research veered off-course (as it often did). I'm grateful to my lab collaborators, Tian Qiu and Ya-Nan Li, for the fruitful discussions and impromptu tutorials that enriched my understanding. I acknowledge the use of generative AI tools, which have proved valuable for ideation, troubleshooting, and code generation and testing. This research was supported by an Australian Government Research Training Program (RTP) Scholarship for my tuition fees.

I am grateful to my parents who have supported me through life's ups and downs and have always been there.

I thank the Achilles running club for the weekly dose of extreme positivity and my marathon running partner, Stephen Green, for constant inspiration; at 70 years old, vision impaired, and undergoing chemotherapy, he continues to run marathons. 

Most importantly, I thank my wife, Marietta, who believed in me and selflessly convinced me to pursue my dream.
