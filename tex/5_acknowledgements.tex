\chapterstar{Acknowledgements}
I thank my supervisor, A/Prof Qiang Tang, for accepting me as a student and for his invaluable guidance whenever my research veered off-course. I'm grateful to my lab collaborators, Tian Qiu and Ya-Nan Li, for the fruitful discussions and impromptu tutorials that enriched my understanding. I acknowledge the use of generative AI tools, which have proved valuable for ideation, troubleshooting, and code generation and testing.

I am grateful to my parents and family who have supported me through life's ups and downs and are always there for me. 

I thank the Achilles running club for the weekly dose of extreme positivity and my Marathon-training mate Stephen Green for constant inspiration, who's 70 years old, vision impaired, on chemotherapy, and still running marathons.

Most importantly, I thank my wife, Marietta, who believed in me and selflessly convinced me to pursue my dream.
