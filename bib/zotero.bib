            Several legislative developments are taking place in Europe that make some regulations converge with others, and one of the most influential is the one that will govern the new digital identity model that arises from the modification of the European Regulation that defines digital identity and electronic trust services. Regulation 910/2014 is called eIDAS and has been essential in developing European-qualified trust services. Regulation (EU) 2024/1183, called eIDAS 2 because it modifies the eIDAS regulation and increases its scope, has been recently published in the Official Journal of the European Union.},

	abstract = {We present UnTraceable Transactions (UTT), a system for decentralized ecash with accountable privacy. UTT is the first ecash system that obtains three critical properties: (1) it provides decentralized trust by implementing the ledger, bank, auditor, and registration authorities via threshold cryptography and Byzantine Fault Tolerant infrastructure; (2) it balances accountability and privacy by implementing anonymity budgets: users can anonymously send payments, but only up to a limited amount of currency per month. Past this point, transactions can either be made public or subjected to customizable auditing rules; (3) by carefully choosing cryptographic building blocks and co-designing the cryptography and decentralization, UTT is tailored for high throughput and low latency. With a combination of optimized cryptographic building blocks and vertical scaling (optimistic concurrency control), UTT can provide almost 1,000 payments with accountable privacy per second, with latencies of around 100 milliseconds and less. Through horizontal scaling (multiple shards), UTT can scale to tens of thousands of such transactions per second. With 60 shards we measure over 10,000 transactions with accountable privacy per second.},

	abstract = {Privacy-enhancing attribute-based credentials (PABCs) are the core ingredient to privacy-friendly authentication systems, allowing users to obtain credentials on attributes and prove possession of these credentials in an unlinkable fashion while revealing only a subset of the attributes. To be useful in practice, however, PABCs typically need additional features such as i) revocation, ii) pooling prevention by binding credentials to users secret keys, iii) pseudonyms as privacy-friendly user public keys, iv) proving equality of attributes without revealing their values, v) or advanced issuance where attributes can be blindly carried over into new credentials. Provably secure solutions exist for most of these features in isolation, but it is unclear how they can be securely combined into a full-ﬂedged PABC system, or even which properties such a system would aim to fulﬁll. We provide a formal treatment of PABC systems supporting the mentioned features by deﬁning their syntax and security properties, resulting in the most comprehensive deﬁnitional framework for PABCs so far. Unlike previous eﬀorts, our deﬁnitions are not targeted at one speciﬁc use-case; rather, we try to capture generic properties that can be useful in a variety of scenarios. We believe that our deﬁnitions can also be used as a starting point for diverse application-dependent extensions and variations of PABCs. We present and prove secure a generic and modular construction of a PABC system from simpler building blocks, allowing for a “plug-and-play” composition based on diﬀerent instantiations of the building blocks. Finally, we give secure instantiations for each of the building blocks, including in particular instantiations based on CL- and Brands-signatures which are the core of the Idemix and U-Prove protocols.},

Largely spurred by the adoption of cryptographic primitives in blockchain systems, ZK-SNARKs are rapidly becoming computationally practical in real-world settings, shown by i.e. tornado.cash and rollups. These have enabled ideation for new identity applications based on anonymous proof-of-ownership. One of the primary technologies that would enable the jump from existing apps to such systems is the development of deterministic nullifiers. Nullifiers are used as a public commitment to a specific anonymous account, to forbid actions like double spending, or allow a consistent identity between anonymous actions. We identify a new deterministic signature algorithm that both uniquely identifies the keypair, and keeps the account identity secret. In this work, we will define the full DDH-VRF construction, and prove uniqueness, secrecy, and existential unforgeability. We will also demonstrate a proof of concept of our Pseudonymously Linked Unique Message Entity (PLUME) scheme.Edited some wordings and added PLUME to the title},

	abstract = {Zero-knowledge succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (zk-SNARKs) are a powerful tool for proving computation correctness, attracting significant interest from researchers, developers, and users. However, the complexity of zk-SNARKs has created gaps between these groups, hindering progress. Researchers focus on constructing efficient proving systems with stronger security and new properties, while developers and users prioritize toolchains, usability, and compatibility.

In this work, we provide a comprehensive study of zk-SNARK, from theory to practice, pinpointing gaps and limitations. We first present a master recipe that unifies the main steps in converting a program into a zk-SNARK. We then classify existing zk-SNARKs according to their key techniques. Our classification addresses the main difference in practically valuable properties between existing zk-SNARK schemes. We survey over 40 zk-SNARKs since 2013 and provide a reference table listing their categories and properties. Following the steps in master recipe, we then survey 11 general-purpose popular used libraries. We elaborate on these libraries' usability, compatibility, efficiency and limitations. Since installing and executing these zk-SNARK systems is challenging, we also provide a completely virtual environment in which to run the compiler for each of them. We identify that the proving system is the primary focus in cryptography academia. In contrast, the constraint system presents a bottleneck in industry. To bridge this gap, we offer recommendations and advocate for the opensource community to enhance documentation, standardization and compatibility.},

We develop new schemes in order to include public metadata such as expiration dates for tokens. This inclusion enables planned mass revocation of tokens without distributing new keys, which for natural instantiations can give 77 \% and 90 \% amortized traﬃc savings compared to Privacy Pass (Davidson et al., 2018) and DIT: De-Identiﬁed Authenticated Telemetry at Scale (Huang et al., 2021), respectively. By transforming the public key, we are able to append public metadata to several existing protocols essentially without increasing computation or communication. Additional contributions include expanded deﬁnitions, a more complete framework for anonymous single-use tokens and a description of how anonymous tokens can improve the privacy in dp3t-like digital contact tracing applications. We also extend the protocol to create eﬃcient and conceptually simple tokens with both public and private metadata, and tokens with public metadata and public veriﬁability from pairings.},

	abstract = {With the increasing use of online services, the protection of the privacy of users becomes more and more important. This is particularly critical as authentication and authorization as realized on the Internet nowadays, typically relies on centralized identity management solutions. Although those are very convenient from a user's perspective, they are quite intrusive from a privacy perspective and are currently far from implementing the concept of data minimization. Fortunately, cryptography offers exciting primitives such as zero-knowledge proofs and advanced signature schemes to realize various forms of so-called anonymous credentials. Such primitives allow to realize online authentication and authorization with a high level of built-in privacy protection (what we call privacy-preserving authentication). Though these primitives have already been researched for various decades and are well understood in the research community, unfortunately, they lack widespread adoption. In this paper, we look at the problems, what cryptography can do, some deployment examples, and barriers to widespread adoption. Latter using the example of the EU Digital Identity Wallet (EUDIW) and the recent discussion and feedback from cryptography experts around this topic. We also briefly comment on the transition to post-quantum cryptography.},

While intermarriage is certainly not limited to these kinds of partnerships, there is reason to believe that these partnerships may become increasingly common when investigated along racial, ethnic, and religious dimensions. This study incorporates interviews with 31 intermarried couples residing in the Los Angeles, Orange County, San Francisco, Oakland, New York, and Philadelphia metropolitan areas. In particular, we highlight participants’ discussions of two main subjects: shared values within their partnerships and racial, ethnic, and religious identities of children, if present. Our paper expands the broader sociological literature on intermarriage as well as the speciﬁc literatures on intermarriage for Jewish Americans and intermarriage for Asian Americans.},

In this paper we give an overview of a variant of the Pippenger MSM algorithm together with a set of optimizations tailored for curves that admit a twisted Edwards form. We prove that this is the case for SNARK-friendly chains and cycles of elliptic curves, which are useful for recursive constructions. Our contribution is twofold: first, we optimize the arithmetic of finite fields by improving on the well-known Coarsely Integrated Operand Scanning (CIOS) modular multiplication. This is a contribution of independent interest that applies to many different contexts. Second, we propose a new coordinate system for twisted Edwards curves tailored for the Pippenger MSM algorithm.Accelerating the MSM over these curves is critical for deployment of recursive proof{\textless} systems applications such as proof-carrying-data, blockchain rollups and blockchain light clients. We implement our work in Go and benchmark it on two different CPU architectures (x86 and arm64). We show that our implementation achieves a 40-47\% speedup over the state-of-the-art implementation (which was implemented in Rust). This MSM implementation won the first place in the ZPrize competition in the open division “Accelerating MSM on Mobile” and will be deployed in two real-world applications: Linea zkEVM by ConsenSys and probably Celo network.},

	abstract = {A cryptographic accumulator is a compressed data structure with associated algorithms used for secure membership testing. In the growing space of digital credentials, accumulators are used to manage sets of valid credentials, giving efficient and anonymous methods for credential holders to prove their validity. Unlike traditional credentials like digital signatures, one can easily revoke credentials with an accumulator; however, each revocation forces existing credential holders to engage in an expensive update process. Previous works make this faster and easier by sacrificing anonymity. To improve performance without compromising privacy, we present ALLOSAUR, a multi-party accumulator based on pairings. In ALLOSAUR, we eliminate the cost of accumulating new credentials, let "credential managers" manage the accumulator values with secure multiparty computation, and allow anonymous credential updates with a square-root reduction in communication costs as compared to existing work.A deployed digital credential system is a vast and complicated system, and existing formalisms do not fully address the scope or power of a real-world adversary. We develop a thorough "UC-style" formalism that allows arbitrary malicious behaviour from an adversary controlling a minority of credential managers and arbitrary numbers of users, credentials, and verifiers. In our new formalism we present a novel definition of privacy that captures as much anonymity as possible while accounting for inevitable losses from interaction with the system. The detail in our formalism reveals real-world issues in existing accumulator constructions, all of which ALLOSAUR avoids.The typical bottleneck in accumulator-based digital credential systems is handling revocations of credentials. Our proof-of-concept implementation of ALLOSAUR can update over 1000 revocations with less than half a second of total computation and 16 kB communication, which is at least a 5x improvement over the previous state-of-the-art in both metrics.},

	abstract = {Differential privacy (DP) is a leading privacy protection  focused by design on individual privacy. In the local model of DP, strong privacy is achieved by privatizing each user’s individual data before sending it to an untrusted aggregator for analysis. While in recent years local DP has been adopted for practical deployments, most research in this area focuses on problems where each individual holds a single data record. In many problems of practical interest this assumption is unrealistic since nowadays most user-owned devices collect large quantities of data (e.g. pictures, text messages, time series). We propose to model this scenario by assuming each individual holds a distribution over the space of data records, and develop novel local DP methods to sample privately from these distributions. Our main contribution is a boosting-based density estimation algorithm for learning samplers that generate synthetic data while protecting the underlying distribution of each user with local DP. We give approximation guarantees quantifying how well these samplers approximate the true distribution. Experimental results against DP kernel density estimation and DP GANs displays the quality of our results.},

	abstract = {We initiate an investigation of private sampling from distributions. Given a dataset with \$n\$ independent observations from an unknown distribution \$P\$, a sampling algorithm must output a single observation from a distribution that is close in total variation distance to \$P\$ while satisfying differential privacy. Sampling abstracts the goal of generating small amounts of realistic-looking data. We provide tight upper and lower bounds for the dataset size needed for this task for three natural families of distributions: arbitrary distributions on \${\textbackslash}\{1,{\textbackslash}ldots ,k{\textbackslash}\}\$, arbitrary product distributions on \${\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, and product distributions on \${\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ with bias in each coordinate bounded away from 0 and 1. We demonstrate that, in some parameter regimes, private sampling requires asymptotically fewer observations than learning a description of \$P\$ nonprivately; in other regimes, however, private sampling proves to be as difficult as private learning. Notably, for some classes of distributions, the overhead in the number of observations needed for private learning compared to non-private learning is completely captured by the number of observations needed for private sampling.},

	abstract = {Many algorithms have been developed to estimate probability distributions subject to differential privacy (DP): such an algorithm takes as input independent samples from a distribution and estimates the density function in a way that is insensitive to any one sample. A recent line of work, initiated by Raskhodnikova et al. (Neurips '21), explores a weaker objective: a differentially private algorithm that approximates a single sample from the distribution. Raskhodnikova et al. studied the sample complexity of DP {\textbackslash}emph\{single-sampling\} i.e., the minimum number of samples needed to perform this task. They showed that the sample complexity of DP single-sampling is less than the sample complexity of DP learning for certain distribution classes. We define two variants of {\textbackslash}emph\{multi-sampling\}, where the goal is to privately approximate \$m\&gt;1\$ samples. This better models the realistic scenario where synthetic data is needed for exploratory data analysis.
 A baseline solution to {\textbackslash}emph\{multi-sampling\} is to invoke a single-sampling algorithm \$m\$ times on independently drawn datasets of samples. When the data comes from a finite domain, we improve over the baseline by a factor of \$m\$ in the sample complexity. When the data comes from a Gaussian, Ghazi et al. (Neurips '23) show that {\textbackslash}emph\{single-sampling\} can be performed under approximate differential privacy; we show it is possible to {\textbackslash}emph\{single- and multi-sample Gaussians with known covariance subject to pure DP\}. Our solution uses a variant of the Laplace mechanism that is of independent interest.
 We also give sample complexity lower bounds, one for strong multi-sampling of finite distributions and another for weak multi-sampling of bounded-covariance Gaussians.},

	abstract = {This study explores the crucial part that governance, risk and compliance play in the field of identity and access management (IAM), as well as the methods for putting IAM systems into place in an efficient manner. IAM is a crucial component of modern enterprises since it supports digitization, improves security management, and ensures compliance with regulation and information security governance. However, it is normal for businesses to face significant obstacles when attempting to use IAM solutions. The emphasis in the current discussion on IAM frequently shifts from strategic considerations to operational ones, pushing the latter to the margins. Organizations are forced to deal with growing internal and external vulnerabilities and threats while also trying to stay within budgetary and resource restrictions. Strategic decision-makers, such as chief information officers and security officers, are forced by this circumstance to make thoughtful judgments about which investment programs to prioritize. IAM investments significantly impact a wide range of strategic goals, including security, agility, assurance, productivity, compliance, and empowerment. Our preliminary findings highlight the importance of compliance-driven IAM methods in contemporary businesses. Therefore, a review is conducted using PRISMA guidelines with an emphasis on the ramifications and developments in the world. The main aim of this research is to help firms implement effective IAM strategies that not only strengthen security and regulatory conformity but also match with more general strategy goals by examining the synergy between governance, risk \& compliance and IAM.},

For instance, existing schemes suited for real-world use lack formal, composable deﬁnitions, partly because they do not support straight-line extraction and rely on random oracles for their security arguments. To address this gap, we propose unlinkable redactable signatures (URS), a new building block for privacy-enhancing protocols, which we use to construct the ﬁrst eﬃcient UC-secure anonymous credential system that supports multiple issuers, selective disclosure of attributes, and pseudonyms. Our scheme is one of the ﬁrst such systems for which both the size of a credential and its presentation proof are independent of the number of attributes issued in a credential. Moreover, our new credential scheme does not rely on random oracles. As an important intermediary step, we address the problem of building a functionality for a complex credential system that can cover many diﬀerent features. Namely, we design a core building block for a single issuer that supports credential issuance and presentation with respect to pseudonyms and then show how to construct a full-ﬂedged credential system with multiple issuers in a modular way. We expect this deﬁnitional approach to be of independent interest.},

We then show how our scheme can be used to construct eﬃcient anonymous credential systems as well as group signature and identity escrow schemes.

	abstract = {In this article, we demonstrate that, ignoring computational constraints, it is possible to release synthetic databases that are useful for accurately answering large classes of queries while preserving differential privacy. Specifically, we give a mechanism that privately releases synthetic data useful for answering a class of queries over a
              discrete
              domain with error that grows as a function of the size of the smallest net approximately representing the answers to that class of queries. We show that this in particular implies a mechanism for counting queries that gives error guarantees that grow only with the VC-dimension of the class of queries, which itself grows at most logarithmically with the size of the query class.
            
            
              We also show that it is not possible to release even simple classes of queries (such as intervals and their generalizations) over
              continuous
              domains with worst-case utility guarantees while preserving differential privacy. In response to this, we consider a relaxation of the utility guarantee and give a privacy preserving polynomial time algorithm that for any halfspace query will provide an answer that is accurate for some small perturbation of the query. This algorithm does not release synthetic data, but instead another data structure capable of representing an answer for each query. We also give an efficient algorithm for releasing synthetic data for the class of interval queries and axis-aligned rectangles of constant dimension over
              discrete

	abstract = {We initiate an investigation of private sampling from distributions. Given a dataset with \$n\$ independent observations from an unknown distribution \$P\$, a sampling algorithm must output a single observation from a distribution that is close in total variation distance to \$P\$ while satisfying differential privacy. Sampling abstracts the goal of generating small amounts of realistic-looking data. We provide tight upper and lower bounds for the dataset size needed for this task for three natural families of distributions: arbitrary distributions on \${\textbackslash}\{1,{\textbackslash}ldots ,k{\textbackslash}\}\$, arbitrary product distributions on \${\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}d\$, and product distributions on \${\textbackslash}\{0,1{\textbackslash}\}{\textasciicircum}d\$ with bias in each coordinate bounded away from 0 and 1. We demonstrate that, in some parameter regimes, private sampling requires asymptotically fewer observations than learning a description of \$P\$ nonprivately; in other regimes, however, private sampling proves to be as difficult as private learning. Notably, for some classes of distributions, the overhead in the number of observations needed for private learning compared to non-private learning is completely captured by the number of observations needed for private sampling.},

	abstract = {Ensuring the privacy of Large Language Models (LLMs) is becoming increasingly important. The most widely adopted technique to accomplish this is DP-SGD, which trains a model to guarantee Differential Privacy (DP). However, DP-SGD overestimates an adversary's capabilities in having white box access to the model and, as a result, causes longer training times and larger memory usage than SGD. On the other hand, commercial LLM deployments are predominantly cloud-based; hence, adversarial access to LLMs is black-box. Motivated by these observations, we present Private Mixing of Ensemble Distributions (PMixED): a private prediction protocol for next-token prediction that utilizes the inherent stochasticity of next-token sampling and a public model to achieve Differential Privacy. We formalize this by introducing RD-mollifers which project each of the model's output distribution from an ensemble of fine-tuned LLMs onto a set around a public LLM's output distribution, then average the projected distributions and sample from it. Unlike DP-SGD which needs to consider the model architecture during training, PMixED is model agnostic, which makes PMixED a very appealing solution for current deployments. Our results show that PMixED achieves a stronger privacy guarantee than sample-level privacy and outperforms DP-SGD for privacy \${\textbackslash}epsilon = 8\$ on large-scale datasets. Thus, PMixED offers a practical alternative to DP training methods for achieving strong generative utility without compromising privacy.},

How can we beneﬁt from the adversary’s uncertainty about the data? We have found that random sampling provides a connection that helps answer these two questions, as sampling can create uncertainty. The main result of the paper is that k-anonymization, when done “safely”, and when preceded with a random sampling step, satisﬁes (ǫ, δ)-diﬀerential privacy with reasonable parameters. This result illustrates that “hiding in a crowd of k” indeed offers some privacy guarantees. We point out, however, that almost all existing k-anonymization algorithms in the literature are not “safe”. Regarding the second question, we provide both positive and negative results. On the positive side, we show that adding a random-sampling pre-processing step to a diﬀerentially-private algorithm can greatly amplify the level of privacy protection. Hence, when given a dataset resulted from sampling, one can utilize a much large privacy budget. On the negative side, any privacy notion that takes advantage of the adversary’s uncertainty, likely does not compose.},

In cryptography, randomness is essential for seed generation, where the computational model used is generally probabilistic. However, ideal randomness, which is usually assumed to be available in computer science theory and applications, might not be available to real systems. Randomness extractors are objects that turn “weak” randomness into almost “ideal” randomness (pseudorandomness).

	abstract = {OpenID Connect (OIDC) is a Single Sign-On (SSO) protocol that allows users to authenticate to various Relying Parties (RPs) via an Identity Provider (IdP). The main drawback of SSO is its lack of privacy, as the IdP learns the RP’s identity at each user’s login. OIDC supports several protocol flows, of which only one, the Implicit Flow, gives hope for any privacy, as it does not require direct communication between the IdP and RP. This design was initially intended for RPs with technical limitations that prevent them from storing credentials and thus authenticating to the IdP. However, RP authentication is crucial to ensure that users only access properly registered RPs. As a result, the Implicit Flow is being discussed to be excluded from the OAuth specification on which OIDC is based. This paper demonstrates a privacy-preserving approach incorporating RP authentication into the Implicit Flow. The IdP can restrict its service to authenticated RPs and tie each authentication token to a specific user and RP without acquiring knowledge of which user is accessing which RP. We formally define the desired security and privacy properties of such an authenticated Implicit Flow, propose a provably secure construction from generic building blocks, and report on an implementation of our scheme.},

While establishing unlinkable identities provides privacy towards RPs, it actually emphasizes the main privacy problem of SSO: with every authentication request, the IdP learns the RP that the user wants to access.

	abstract = {Single sign-on (SSO) allows a user to maintain only the credential at the identity provider (IdP), to login to numerous RPs. However, SSO introduces extra privacy threats, compared with traditional authentication mechanisms, as (a) the IdP could track all RPs which a user is visiting, and (b) collusive RPs could learn a user’s online proﬁle by linking his identities across these RPs. This paper proposes a privacypreserving SSO system, called UPPRESSO, to protect a user’s login activities against both the curious IdP and collusive RPs. We analyze the identity dilemma between the security requirements and these privacy concerns, and convert the SSO privacy problems into an identity transformation challenge. In each login instance, an ephemeral pseudo-identity (denoted as P IDRP ) of the RP, is ﬁrstly negotiated between the user and the RP. P IDRP is sent to the IdP and designated in the identity token, so the IdP is not aware of the visited RP. Meanwhile, P IDRP is used by the IdP to transform the permanent user identity IDU into an ephemeral user pseudo-identity (denoted as P IDU ) in the identity token. On receiving the identity token, the RP transforms P IDU into a permanent account (denoted as Acct) of the user, by an ephemeral trapdoor in the negotiation. Given a user, the account at each RP is unique and different from IDU , so collusive RPs cannot link his identities across these RPs. We build the UPPRESSO prototype on top of MITREid Connect, an open-source implementation of OIDC. The extensive evaluation shows that UPPRESSO fulﬁlls the requirements of both security and privacy and introduces reasonable overheads.},

The security of this construction reduces to a novel property of accumulators, insertion security. We first show that not all accumulators are insertion-secure. We then prove that common constructions (Merkle trees, RSA accumulators, and bilinear accumulators) are either naturally insertion-secure or can be made so with trivial modifications. Finally, we give two generic constructions for insertion-secure accumulators, from universal accumulators and vector commitments respectively.},

	abstract = {The security of any cryptosystem relies on the secrecy of the system’s secret keys. Yet, recent experimental work demonstrates that tens of thousands of devices on the Internet use RSA and DSA secrets drawn from a small pool of candidate values. As a result, an adversary can derive the device’s secret keys without breaking the underlying cryptosystem. We introduce a new threat model, under which there is a systemic solution to such randomness ﬂaws. In our model, when a device generates a cryptographic key, it incorporates some random values from an entropy authority into its cryptographic secrets and then proves to the authority, using zero-knowledge-proof techniques, that it performed this operation correctly. By presenting an entropy-authority-signed public-key certiﬁcate to a third party (like a certiﬁcate authority or SSH client), the device can demonstrate that its public key incorporates randomness from the authority and is therefore drawn from a large pool of candidate values. Where possible, our protocol protects against eavesdroppers, entropy authority misbehavior, and devices attempting to discredit the entropy authority. To demonstrate the practicality of our protocol, we have implemented and evaluated its performance on a commodity wireless home router. When running on a home router, our protocol incurs a 1.7× slowdown over conventional RSA key generation and it incurs a 3.6× slowdown over conventional EC-DSA key generation.},

	abstract = {Bias-resistant public randomness is a critical component in many (distributed) protocols. Generating public randomness is hard, however, because active adversaries may behave dishonestly to bias public random choices toward their advantage. Existing solutions do not scale to hundreds or thousands of participants, as is needed in many decentralized systems. We propose two large-scale distributed protocols, RandHound and RandHerd, which provide publicly-veriﬁable, unpredictable, and unbiasable randomness against Byzantine adversaries. RandHound relies on an untrusted client to divide a set of randomness servers into groups for scalability, and it depends on the pigeonhole principle to ensure output integrity, even for non-random, adversarial group choices. RandHerd implements an efﬁcient, decentralized randomness beacon. RandHerd is structurally similar to a BFT protocol, but uses RandHound in a one-time setup to arrange participants into veriﬁably unbiased random secret-sharing groups, which then repeatedly produce random output at predeﬁned intervals. Our prototype demonstrates that RandHound and RandHerd achieve good performance across hundreds of participants while retaining a low failure probability by properly selecting protocol parameters, such as a group size and secret-sharing threshold. For example, when sharding 512 nodes into groups of 32, our experiments show that RandHound can produce fresh random output after 240 seconds. RandHerd, after a setup phase of 260 seconds, is able to generate fresh random output in intervals of approximately 6 seconds. For this conﬁguration, both protocols operate at a failure probability of at most 0.08\% against a Byzantine adversary.},

Thus, the simple fact that a cryptographic algorithm withstands cryptanalytic attacks for several years is often considered as a kind of validation procedure. A much more convincing line of research has tried to provide “provable” security for cryptographic protocols. Unfortunately, in many cases, provable security is at the cost of a considerable loss in terms of efﬁciency. Another way to achieve some kind of provable security is to identify concrete cryptographic objects, such as hash functions, with ideal random objects and to use arguments from relativized complexity theory. The model underlying this approach is often called the “random oracle model.” We use the word “arguments” for security results proved in this model. As usual, these arguments are relative to wellestablished hard algorithmic problems such as factorization or the discrete logarithm.},

For these purely modeling-related messages, which do not reﬂect actual network communication, it would often be very reasonable and natural for adversaries/environments to provide the requested information immediately or give control back to the protocol/functionality immediately after having received some information. However, in none of the existing models for universal composability is this guaranteed. We call this the non-responsiveness problem. As we will discuss in the paper, while formally non-responsiveness does not invalidate any of the universal composability models, it has many disadvantages, such as unnecessarily complex speciﬁcations and less expressivity. Also, this problem has often been ignored in the literature, leading to ill-deﬁned and ﬂawed speciﬁcations. Protocol designers really should not have to care about this problem at all, but currently they have to: giving the adversary/environment the option to not respond immediately to modeling-related requests does not translate to any real attack scenario.},

	abstract = {In this paper, we present a simpler and more restricted variant of the universally composable security (UC) framework that is suitable for ``standard'' two-party and multiparty computation tasks. Many of the complications of the UC framework exist in order to enable more general tasks than classic secure computation. This generality may be a barrier to entry for those who are used to the stand-alone model of secure computation and wish to work with universally composable security but are overwhelmed by the differences. The variant presented here (called simplified universally composable security, or just SUC) is closer to the definition of security for multiparty computation in the stand-alone setting. The main difference is that a protocol in the SUC framework runs with a {\textbackslash}emph\{fixed set of parties\} who know each other's identities ahead of time, and machines {\textbackslash}emph\{cannot be added dynamically\} to the execution. As a result, the definitions of polynomial time and protocol composition are much simpler. In addition, the SUC framework has authenticated channels built in, as is standard in previous definitions of security, and all communication is done via the adversary in order to enable arbitrary scheduling of messages. Due to these differences, not all cryptographic tasks can be expressed in the SUC framework. Nevertheless, standard secure computation tasks (like secure function evaluation) can be expressed. Importantly, we show a natural security-preserving transformation from protocols in the SUC model to protocols in the full-fledged UC model. Consequently, the UC composition theorem holds in the SUC model, and any protocol that is proven secure under SUC can be transformed to a protocol that is secure in the UC model.},

important in practice to design an identity-based threshold
decryption scheme in which a private key associated with an
identity is shared. A major contribution of this paper is to
construct the first identity-based threshold decryption scheme
secure against chosen ciphertext attack. A formal proof of
security of the scheme is provided in the random oracle model,
assuming the Bilinear Diffie-Hellman problem is computationally
hard. Another contribution of this paper is, by extending the
proposed identity-based threshold decryption scheme, to construct
a mediated identity-based encryption scheme secure against more
powerful attacks than those considered previously.},

These datasets are increasingly seen as valuable assets, e.g., due to the difficulty in obtaining them (sensitive, regulated, or carefully curated user data), generating them (computeheavy processes), or trusting them (poisoning attacks). For companies owning such datasets, this leads to a thorny issue: how to convince interested customers that a dataset is reliable and has the application-specific statistical properties they need, while revealing as little data as possible? This project will combine recent advances in machine learning, distributed inference, and differential privacy with insights and techniques from the cryptography community to design principled approaches to address this problem. The outcome of this project will be fast, private, communication-efficient, and cryptographically secure protocols for asymmetric data analysis, where data holders interact with the data buyers while provably keeping their datasets undisclosed.},

Interestingly, despite being designed for privacy-preserving applications, they require strong trust in these central authorities who constitute single points of failure for critical security properties. To reduce the trust placed on authorities, we introduce dynamic group signatures which distribute the role of issuer and opener over several entities, and support tI -out-of-nI issuance and tO-out-of-nO opening. We ﬁrst deﬁne threshold dynamic group signatures and formalize their security. We then give an eﬃcient construction relying on the pairing-based Pointcheval–Sanders (PS) signature scheme (CT-RSA 2018), which yields very short group signatures of two ﬁrst-group elements and three ﬁeld elements. We also give a simpler variant of our scheme in which issuance requires the participation of all nI issuers, but still supports tO-out-of-nO opening. It is based on a new multi-signature variant of the PS scheme which allows for eﬃcient proofs of knowledge and is a result of independent interest. We prove our schemes secure in the random-oracle model under a non-interactive q-type of assumption.},

The main reasons behind this are performance efficiency issues, lack of interoperability with standards, and the centralized architectural scheme that relies on a unique Identity Provider (IdP) for credential issuance. To cope with these limitations, this paper describes the first implementation of the Pointcheval–Sanders Multi-Signatures (PS-MS) crypto scheme proposed by Camenisch et al. and its integration in a distributed and privacy-preserving identity management system proposed in OLYMPUS H2020 European research project. Our efficient implementation provides remarkable privacy-preservation features for identity management in online transactions leveraging p-ABC systems, including unforgeability, minimal disclosure of personal data through zero-knowledge proofs, unlinkability in online transactions and fully distributed credential issuance across different IdPs, thereby removing the IdP as a unique point of failure. The performance of the implementation has been exhaustively analyzed and evaluated with different curves, signers and number of attributes, and compared against Identity Mixer, the best known p-ABC system, outperforming significantly the credential issuance and zero-knowledge proving and verification processes (2–4 times less execution time).},

By using our revocation scheme together with existing PABCs, it is possible to prove attribute ownership in constant time and verify the proof and the revocation status in the time logarithmic in the number of revoked users, independently of the number of all valid users in the system. Proofs can be eﬃciently generated using only oﬄine constrained devices, such as existing smart-cards. These features are achieved by using a new construction called n-times unlinkable proofs. We show the full cryptographic description of the scheme, prove its security, discuss parameters inﬂuencing scalability and provide details on implementation aspects. As a side result of independent interest, we design a more eﬃcient proof of knowledge of weak Boneh-Boyen signatures, that does not require any pairing computation on the prover side.},

	abstract = {Recent years have seen the emergence of practical advanced cryptographic tools that not only protect data privacy and authenticity, but also allow for jointly processing data from different institutions without sacrificing privacy. The ability to do so has enabled implementations a number of traditional and decentralized financial applications that would have required sacrificing privacy or trusting a third party. The main catalyst of this revolution was the advent of decentralized cryptocurrencies that use public ledgers to register financial transactions, which must be verifiable by any third party, while keeping sensitive data private. Zero Knowledge (ZK) proofs rose to prominence as a solution to this challenge, allowing for the owner of sensitive data (e.g. the identities of users involved in an operation) to convince a third party verifier that a certain operation has been correctly executed without revealing said data. It quickly became clear that performing arbitrary computation on private data from multiple sources by means of secure Multiparty Computation (MPC) and related techniques allows for more powerful financial applications, also in traditional finance.

In this SoK, we categorize the main traditional and decentralized financial applications that can benefit from state-of-the-art Privacy-Enhancing Technologies (PETs) and identify design patterns commonly used when applying PETs in the context of these applications. In particular, we consider the following classes of applications: 1. Identity Management, KYC \& AML; and 2. Markets \& Settlement; 3. Legal; and 4. Digital Asset Custody. We examine how ZK proofs, MPC and related PETs have been used to tackle the main security challenges in each of these applications. Moreover, we provide an assessment of the technological readiness of each PET in the context of different financial applications according to the availability of: theoretical feasibility results, preliminary benchmarks (in scientific papers) or benchmarks achieving real-world performance (in commercially deployed solutions). Finally, we propose future applications of PETs as Fintech solutions to currently unsolved issues. While we systematize financial applications of PETs at large, we focus mainly on those applications that require privacy preserving computation on data from multiple parties.},

Our constructions enforce that each client will be able to obtain only one token per message and we show a generic transformation to support other rate limiting as well. We achieve this new property while maintaining the unforgeability and unlinkability properties required for anonymous tokens schemes. We present four ACT constructions with various trade-oﬀs for their eﬃciency and underlying security assumptions. One construction uses factorization-based primitives and a cyclic group. It is secure in the random oracle model under the q-DDHI assumption (in a cyclic group) and the DCR assumption. Our three other constructions use bilinear maps: one is secure in the standard model under q-DDHI and SXDH, one is secure in the random oracle model under SXDH, and the most eﬃcient of the three is secure in the random oracle model and generic bilinear group model.},

Early implementations of such systems, like Bitcoin or Ethereum, provide virtually no privacy beyond basic pseudonymity: all transactions are written in plain to the blockchain, which makes them linkable and traceable. Several more recent blockchain systems, such as Monero or Zerocash, implement improved levels of privacy. Most of these systems target the permissionless setting, and as such are not suited for enterprise networks. These require token systems to be permissioned and to bind tokens to user identities instead of pseudonymous addresses. They also require auditing functionalities in order to satisfy regulations such as AML/KYC. We present a privacy-preserving token management system that is designed for permissioned blockchains and supports fine-grained auditing. The scheme is secure under computational assumptions in bilinear groups, in the random-oracle model. We provide performance measurements for our prototype implementation built on top of Hyperledger Fabric.},

Central Digital Identity providers control and know our data and thereby our Identity. Self Sovereign Identities are based on decentralized data storage and data exchange architecture, where the user is in sole control of his data and identity. Most of the issued credentials need the possibility of revocation. For a centrally managed Digital Identity system, revocation is not a problem. In decentral architectures, revocation is more challenging. Revocation can be done with different methods e.g. list based, cryptographic accumulators and with credential updates. A revocation method must be privacy preserving and must scale.

However, users may misbehave under the cover of anonymity, thus, accountability is crucial in any practical privacy-preserving authentication. Balancing anonymity and accountability has always been a challenging research problem in privacy protection. Accountable anonymous credentials are the cryptographic schemes designed to address this challenge. Users are allowed to anonymously prove their possession of valid credentials to protect user privacy. If they misbehave, they will be de-anonymized or blacklisted. In other words, it is technically possible for a system to achieve both anonymity and accountability simultaneously. In this chapter, we review the concept of anonymous credentials and discuss various accountability mechanisms. We discuss how the recent development of blockchain and quantum computers have inﬂuenced the recent research advances in this area. Finally, we also discuss how anonymous credentials are applied in real-world applications in cryptocurrencies.},

To facilitate a framing which supports the comparison of concretely very different protocols, we define an epoch-based computational model in the form of a flexible UC-style ideal functionality which divides the operation of privacy-preserving networks into three phases: Independent, Mediated, and Global computation. Our analysis of protocols focuses in particular on features of the Mediated computation phase, which provides the facility to execute non-trivial program logic on private inputs from multiple users. Specifically, we compare implementations in different protocols for private limit order auctions, which we find to be a representative application which is common and relatively simple, but which exhibits adversarial dynamics which demonstrate the capabilities of a non-trivial Mediated computation mechanism. In our analysis, we identify four protocols representative of different high-level approaches used to implement Mediated computations. We compare protocols according to the degree and flexibility of programmability, the privacy properties achieved, and the security assumptions required for correct operation. We conclude by offering recommendations and best practices for future programmable privacy designs.},

However, it does not support threshold tracing of user identities and threshold revocation of user credentials, which is desired for internal governance such as identity management, data auditing, and accountability. The communication and computation complexities of Coconut for verifying credentials are linear in the number of each user’s attributes and thus costly. Addressing these issues, we propose a novel efﬁcient threshold attribute-based anonymous credential scheme. While retaining all the features of Coconut, our scheme supports threshold tracing of user identities and threshold revocation of user credentials, and it signiﬁcantly reduces the computational and communication complexities of credential veriﬁcation. In addition, we prove that our scheme enjoys strong security features, including anonymity, blindness, traceability, and non-frameability.},

Specifically, we design a decentralized credential management architecture where multiple authorities form an alliance and manage credentials collaboratively. Then, we propose a threshold credential management scheme, where user issuance and revocation must be approved by multiple credential managers, and a user can aggregate her/his credentials and prove them to a verifier simultaneously.

	abstract = {Anonymous credentials (AC) offer privacy in user-centric identity management. They enable users to authenticate anonymously, revealing only necessary attributes. With the rise of decentralized systems like self-sovereign identity, the demand for efficient AC systems in a decentralized setting has grown. Relying on conventional AC systems, however, require users to present independent credentials when obtaining them from different issuers, leading to increased complexity. AC systems should ideally support being multi-authority for efficient presentation of multiple credentials from various issuers. Another vital property is issuer hiding, ensuring that the issuer’s identity remains concealed, revealing only compliance with the verifier’s policy. This prevents unique identification based on the sole combination of credential issuers. To date, there exists no AC scheme satisfying both properties simultaneously. This paper introduces Issuer-Hiding Multi-Authority Anonymous Credentials (IhMA), utilizing two novel signature primitives: Aggregate Signatures with Randomizable Tags and Public Keys and Aggregate Mercurial Signatures. We provide two constructions of IhMA with different trade-offs based on these primitives and believe that they will have applications beyond IhMA. Besides defining the notations and rigorous security definitions for our primitives, we provide provably secure and efficient constructions, and present benchmarks to showcase practical efficiency.},

	abstract = {Certification of keys and attributes is in practice typically realized by a hierarchy of issuers. Revealing the full chain of issuers for certificate verification, however, can be a privacy issue since it can leak sensitive information about the issuer’s organizational structure or about the certificate owner. Delegatable anonymous credentials solve this problem and allow one to hide the full delegation (issuance) chain, providing privacy during both delegation and presentation of certificates. However, the existing delegatable credentials schemes are not efficient enough for practical use.},

We propose a practical scheme to apply the same data minimization principle when the veriﬁers’ authentication logs are subjected to external audits. Namely, we propose an extended PABC scheme where the veriﬁer can further remove attributes from presentation tokens before handing them to an auditor, while preserving the veriﬁability of the audited tokens. We present a generic construction based on a signature, a signature of knowledge and a trapdoor commitment scheme, prove it secure in the universal composability framework, and give eﬃcient instantiations based on the strong RSA and Decision Composite Residuosity (DCR) assumptions in the random-oracle model.},

In this study, we build on rich qualitative data gathered from SSI experts and practitioners to give a fresh overview of the perceived benefits and challenges of SSI. The paper advances research on the domain of SSI adoption and provides valuable insights into the feasibility of SSI for practitioners both in the private and public sectors.},

This paper provides a new perspective for reducing digital identity management systems (DIMS) to two mappings, the core operations on the mappings, and the trust model built around the mappings. Using this two-mapping view, we derive criteria for determining whether a DIMS solution is selfsovereign. We also compare decentralized identity management solutions with the traditional centralized identity management solutions. From the comparison and analysis, we have the following ﬁndings. The differences between decentralized and centralized solutions stem from the trust model differences which dictate storage scheme differences, and therefore other operation-level differences. With a more trustless trust model and storage scheme, current decentralized solutions can be promising candidates for self-sovereign DIMS. Design considerations and certain limitations of the current decentralized solutions are analyzed based on the two-mapping view as well, which can provide useful directions to further study.},

Our proofs of security are based on a decisional bilinear Diﬃe-Hellman inversion assumption, which seems reasonable given current state of knowledge. For small message spaces, our VRF’s proofs and keys have constant size. By utilizing a collision-resistant hash function, our VRF can also be used with arbitrary message spaces. We show that our scheme can be instantiated with an elliptic group of very reasonable size. Furthermore, it can be made distributed and proactive.},

Our framework enjoys a number of interesting features: – conceptual simplicity, parameters derive from the Σ-protocol; – proofs as short as resulting from the Fiat-Shamir heuristic applied to the underlying Σ-protocol; – fully adaptive soundness and perfect zero-knowledge in the common random string model with a single random group element as CRS; – yields simple and eﬃcient two-round, public coin, publicly-veriﬁable perfect witness-indistinguishable (WI) arguments(ZAPs) in the plain model.

We study doubly-efﬁcient interactive proof systems that can be used to verify properties of an unknown distribution over a domain [N ]. On top of efﬁcient veriﬁcation, our focus is on proofs that the honest prover can generate in polynomial time.

We prove the pseudo-randomness of one construction under the assumption that factoring (Blum integers) is hard while the other construction is pseudo-random if the decisional version of the Diffie--Hellman assumption holds. Computing the value of our functions at any given point involves two subset products. This is much more efficient than previous proposals. Furthermore, these functions have the advantage of being in TC0 (the class of functions computable by constant depth circuits consisting of a polynomial number of threshold gates). This fact has several interesting applications. The simple algebraic structure of the functions implies additional features such as a zero-knowledge proof for statements of the form "y = fs(x)" and "y ≠ fs(x)" given a commitment to a key s of a pseudo-random function fs.},

	abstract = {Equivalence class signatures (EQS), introduced by Hanser and Slamanig (AC'14), sign vectors of elements from a bilinear group. Signatures can be ``adapted'', meaning that anyone can transform a signature on a vector to a (random) signature on any multiple of that vector. (Signatures thus authenticate equivalence classes.) A transformed signature/message pair is then indistinguishable from a random signature on a random message. EQS have been used to efficiently instantiate (delegatable) anonymous credentials, (round-optimal) blind signatures, ring and group signatures and anonymous tokens. 

The original EQS construction (J.Crypto'19) is only proven in the generic group model, while the first construction from standard assumptions (PKC'18) only yields security guarantees insufficient for most applications. Two works (AC'19, PKC'22) propose applicable schemes which assume the existence of a common reference string for the anonymity notion. Their unforgeability is argued via a security proof from standard (or non-interactive) assumptions.

In this work we show that their security proof is flawed and explain the subtle issue.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/1120},
	abstract = {Structure-preserving signatures on equivalence classes (SPS-EQ) introduced at ASIACRYPT 2014 are a variant of SPS where a message is considered as a projective equivalence class, and a new representative of the same class can be obtained by multiplying a vector by a scalar. Given a message and corresponding signature, anyone can produce an updated and randomized signature on an arbitrary representative from the same equivalence class. SPS-EQ have proven to be a very versatile building block for many cryptographic applications.

In this paper, we present the first EUF-CMA secure SPS-EQ scheme under standard assumptions. So far only constructions in the generic group model are known. One recent candidate under standard assumptions are the weakly secure equivalence class signatures by Fuchsbauer and Gay (PKC'18), a variant of SPS-EQ satisfying only a weaker unforgeability and adaption notion. Fuchsbauer and Gay show that this weaker unforgeability notion is sufficient for many known applications of SPS-EQ. Unfortunately, the weaker adaption notion is only proper for a semi-honest (passive) model and as we show in this paper, makes their scheme unusable in the current models for almost all of their advertised applications of SPS-EQ from the literature.

We then present a new EUF-CMA secure SPS-EQ scheme with a tight security reduction under the SXDH assumption providing the notion of perfect adaption (under malicious keys). To achieve the strongest notion of perfect adaption under malicious keys, we require a common reference string (CRS), which seems inherent for constructions under standard assumptions. However, for most known applications of SPS-EQ we do not require a trusted CRS (as the CRS can be generated by the signer during key generation). Technically, our construction is inspired by a recent work of Gay et al. (EUROCRYPT'18), who construct a tightly secure message authentication code and translate it to an SPS scheme adapting techniques due to Bellare and Goldwasser (CRYPTO'89).},

	abstract = {Structure-preserving signatures (SPS) have emerged as an important cryptographic building block, as their compatibility with the Groth-Sahai (GS) NIZK framework allows to construct protocols under standard assumptions with reasonable efficiency.
Over the last years there has been a significant interest in the design of threshold signature schemes. However, only very recently Crites et al. (ASIACRYPT 2023) have introduced threshold SPS (TSPS) along with a fully non-interactive construction. While this is an important step, their work comes with several limitations. With respect to the construction, they require the use of random oracles, interactive complexity assumptions and are restricted to so called indexed Diffie-Hellman message spaces. Latter limits the use of their construction as a drop-in replacement for SPS. When it comes to security, they only support static corruptions and do not allow partial signature queries for the forgery. 
In this paper, we ask whether it is possible to construct TSPS without such restrictions. We start from an SPS from Kiltz, Pan and Wee (CRYPTO 2015) which has an interesting structure, but thresholdizing it requires some modifications. Interestingly, we can prove it secure in the strongest model (TS-UF-1) for fully non-interactive threshold signatures (Bellare et al., CRYPTO 2022) and even under fully adaptive corruptions. Surprisingly, we can show the latter under a standard assumption without requiring any idealized model. All known constructions of efficient threshold signatures in the discrete logarithm setting require interactive assumptions and idealized models. 
Concretely, our scheme in type III bilinear groups under the SXDH assumption has signatures consisting of 7 group elements. Compared to the TSPS from Crites et al. (2 group elements), this comes at the cost of efficiency. However, our scheme is secure under standard assumptions, achieves strong and adaptive security guarantees and supports general message spaces, i.e., represents a drop-in replacement for many SPS applications. Given these features, the increase in the size of the signature seems acceptable even for practical applications.},

We formally define PAS and give a construction framework to yield a logarithmic size signature, and further reduce the verification time also to logarithmic. We also give several instantiations for several concrete predicates that may be of independent interest.

	abstract = {In the classical model of computation, it is well established that one-way functions (OWF) are minimal for computational cryptography: They are essential for almost any cryptographic application that cannot be realized with respect to computationally unbounded adversaries. In the quantum setting, however, OWFs appear not to be essential (Kretschmer 2021; Ananth et al., Morimae and Yamakawa 2022), and the question of whether such a minimal primitive exists remains open.

We consider EFI pairs — efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states. Building on the work of Yan (2022), which shows equivalence between EFI pairs and statistical commitment schemes, we show that EFI pairs are necessary for a large class of quantum-cryptographic applications. Specifically, we construct EFI pairs from minimalistic versions of commitments schemes, oblivious transfer, and general secure multiparty computation, as well as from 𝖰𝖢𝖹𝖪 proofs from essentially any non-trivial language. We also construct quantum computational zero knowledge (𝖰𝖢𝖹𝖪) proofs for all of 𝖰𝖨𝖯 from any EFI pair.

This suggests that, for much of quantum cryptography, EFI pairs play a similar role to that played by OWFs in the classical setting: they are simple to describe, essential, and also serve as a linchpin for demonstrating equivalence between primitives.},

This shows that even though real-valued unitaries cannot be completely pseudorandom (Haug, Bharti, Koh, arXiv:2306.11677), we can still obtain some pseudorandom properties without giving up on the simplicity of a real-valued unitary. Our analysis shows that an even simpler construction: applying a random (binary) phase followed by a random computational-basis permutation, would suffice, assuming that the input is orthogonal and {\textbackslash}emph\{flat\} (that is, has high min-entropy when measured in the computational basis).

	abstract = {We study the design of practical blind signatures in the universal composability (UC) setting against adaptive adversaries. We introduce a new property for blind signature schemes that is fundamental for managing adaptive adversaries: an equivocal blind signature is a blind signature protocol where a simulator can construct the internal state of the client so that it matches a simulated transcript even after a signature was released. We present a general construction methodology for building practical adaptively secure blind signatures: the starting point is a 2-move “lite blind signature”, a lightweight 2-party signature protocol that we formalize and implement both generically as well as number theoretically: formalizing a primitive as “lite” means that the adversary is required to show all private tapes of adversarially controlled parties; this enables us to conveniently separate zero-knowledge (ZK) related security requirements from the remaining security properties in the primitive’s design methodology. We then focus on the exact ZK requirements for building blind signatures. To this effect, we formalize two special ZK ideal functionalities, single-veriﬁer-ZK (SVZK) and single-prover-ZK (SPZK) and we investigate the requirements for realizing them in a commit-and-prove fashion as building blocks for adaptively secure UC blind signatures. SVZK can be realized without relying on a multi-session UC commitment; as a result, we realize SVZK in a very efﬁcient manner using number theoretic mixed commitments while employing a constant size common reference string and without the need to satisfy non-malleability. Regarding SPZK we ﬁnd the rather surprising result that realizing it only for static adversaries is sufﬁcient to obtain adaptive security for UC blind signatures. This important observation simpliﬁes blind signature design substantially as one can realize SPZK very efﬁciently in a commit-and-prove fashion using merely an extractable commitment.},

	abstract = {The phenomenon of reduced athletic performance following sustained, intense training (Overtraining Syndrome, and OTS) was first recognized more than 90 years ago. Although hundreds of scientific publications have focused on OTS, a definitive diagnosis, reliable biomarkers, and effective treatments remain unknown. The present review considers existing models of OTS, acknowledges the individualized and sport-specific nature of signs/symptoms, describes potential interacting predisposing factors, and proposes that OTS will be most effectively characterized and evaluated via the underlying complex biological systems. Complex systems in nature are not aptly characterized or successfully analyzed using the classic scientific method (i.e., simplifying complex problems into single variables in a search for cause-and-effect) because they result from myriad (often non-linear) concomitant interactions of multiple determinants. Thus, this review 1) proposes that OTS be viewed from the perspectives of complex systems and network physiology, 2) advocates for and recommends that techniques such as trans-omic analyses and machine learning be widely employed, and 3) proposes evidence-based areas for future OTS investigations, including concomitant multi-domain analyses incorporating brain neural networks, dysfunction of hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal responses to training stress, the intestinal microbiota, immune factors, and low energy availability. Such an inclusive and modern approach will measurably help in prevention and management of OTS.},

We prove that due to the structure of the BBS+ signature, simply verifying the signature produced by an otherwise semi-honest protocol is sufficient to achieve composable security against a malicious adversary. Consequently, our protocol is extremely simple and efficient: it involves a single request from the client (who requires a signature) to the signing parties, two exchanges of messages among the signing parties, and finally a response to the client; in some deployment scenarios the concrete cost bottleneck may be the client's local verification of the signature that it receives. Furthermore, our protocol can be extended to support the strongest form of blind signing and to serve as a distributed evaluation protocol for the Dodis-Yampolskiy Oblivious VRF. We validate our efficiency claims by implementing and benchmarking our protocol.},

	volume = {12492},
	url = {http://arxiv.org/abs/2007.01668},
	abstract = {Secure delegated quantum computing allows a computationally weak client to outsource an arbitrary quantum computation to an untrusted quantum server in a privacy-preserving manner. One of the promising candidates to achieve classical delegation of quantum computation is classical-client remote state preparation (\$RSP\_\{CC\}\$), where a client remotely prepares a quantum state using a classical channel. However, the privacy loss incurred by employing \$RSP\_\{CC\}\$ as a sub-module is unclear. In this work, we investigate this question using the Constructive Cryptography framework by Maurer and Renner (ICS'11). We first identify the goal of \$RSP\_\{CC\}\$ as the construction of ideal RSP resources from classical channels and then reveal the security limitations of using \$RSP\_\{CC\}\$. First, we uncover a fundamental relationship between constructing ideal RSP resources (from classical channels) and the task of cloning quantum states. Any classically constructed ideal RSP resource must leak to the server the full classical description (possibly in an encoded form) of the generated quantum state, even if we target computational security only. As a consequence, we find that the realization of common RSP resources, without weakening their guarantees drastically, is impossible due to the no-cloning theorem. Second, the above result does not rule out that a specific \$RSP\_\{CC\}\$ protocol can replace the quantum channel at least in some contexts, such as the Universal Blind Quantum Computing (UBQC) protocol of Broadbent et al. (FOCS '09). However, we show that the resulting UBQC protocol cannot maintain its proven composable security as soon as \$RSP\_\{CC\}\$ is used as a subroutine. Third, we show that replacing the quantum channel of the above UBQC protocol by the \$RSP\_\{CC\}\$ protocol QFactory of Cojocaru et al. (Asiacrypt '19), preserves the weaker, game-based, security of UBQC.},

	abstract = {One of the most important tools for assessing hardness assumptions in cryptography is the Generic Group Model (GGM). Over the past two decades, numerous assumptions have been analyzed within this model. While a proof in the GGM can certainly provide some measure of confidence in an assumption, its scope is rather limited since it does not capture group-specific algorithms that make use of the representation of the group.

To overcome this limitation, we propose the Algebraic Group Model (AGM), a model that lies in between the standard model and the GGM. It is the first restricted model of computation covering group-specific algorithms yet allowing to derive simple and meaningful security statements.
We show that several important assumptions, among them the Computational Diffie-Hellman, the Strong Diffie-Hellman, and the interactive LRSW assumptions, are equivalent to the Discrete Logarithm (DLog) assumption in the AGM. On the more practical side, we prove tight security reductions for two important schemes in the AGM to DLog or a variant thereof: the BLS signature scheme and Groth's zero-knowledge SNARK (Eurocrypt '16), which is the most efficient SNARK for which only a proof in the GGM was known.

Moreover, in combination with known lower bounds on the Discrete Logarithm assumption in the GGM, our results can be used to derive lower bounds for all the above-mentioned results in the GGM.},

it is computationally infeasible to tell which one. Their technique also implies that it is possible to have NIWI Groth-Sahai proofs for certain types of equations over bilinear groups in the plain model. We extend the result of Groth, Ostrovsky and Sahai in several directions. Given as input some predicate \$P\$ computable by some monotone span program over a finite field, we show how to generate a set of common reference strings in such a way that it can be publicly verified that the subset of them which guarantees perfect soundness is accepted by the span program. We give several different flavors of the technique suitable for different applications scenarios and different equation types. We use this to stretch the expressivity of Groth-Sahai proofs and construct NIZK proofs of partial satisfiability of sets of equations in a bilinear group and more efficient Groth-Sahai NIWI proofs without common reference string for a larger class of equation types. Finally, we apply our results to significantly reduce the size of the signatures of the ring signature scheme of Chandran, Groth and Sahai or to have a more efficient proof in the standard model that a commitment opens to an element of a public list.},

	abstract = {Malleability for cryptography is not necessarily an opportunity for attack, but in many cases a potentially useful feature that can be exploited. In this work, we examine notions of malleability for non-interactive zero-knowledge (NIZK) proofs. We start by defining a malleable proof system, and then consider ways to meaningfully control the malleability of the proof system, as in many settings we would like to guarantee that only certain types of transformations can be performed. We also define notions for the cases in which we do not necessarily want a user to know that a proof has been obtained by applying a particular transformation; these are analogous to function/circuit privacy for encryption.

As our motivating application, we consider a shorter proof for verifiable shuffles. Our controlled-malleable proofs allow us for the first time to use one compact proof to prove the correctness of an entire multi-step shuffle. Each authority takes as input a set of encrypted votes and a controlled-malleable NIZK proof that these are a shuffle of the original encrypted votes submitted by the voters; it then permutes and re-randomizes these votes and updates the proof by exploiting its controlled malleability. As another application, we generically use controlled-malleable proofs to realize a strong notion of encryption security.

Finally, we examine malleability in existing proof systems and observe that Groth-Sahai proofs are malleable. We then go beyond this observation by characterizing all the ways in which they are malleable, and use them to efficiently instantiate our generic constructions from above; this means we can instantiate our proofs and all their applications using only the Decision Linear (DLIN) assumption.},

In this setting we can use message authentication codes (MACs) instead of public key signatures as the basis for the credential system.

To this end, we construct two algebraic MACs in prime-order groups, along with efficient protocols for issuing credentials, asserting possession a credential, and proving statements about hidden attributes (e.g., the age of the credential owner). We prove the security of the first scheme in the generic group model, and prove the security of the second scheme -- using a dual-system-based approach -- under decisional Diffie-Hellman (DDH). Our MACs are of independent interest, as they are the only uf-cmva-secure MACs with efficient proofs of knowledge.

Finally, we compare the efficiency of our new systems to two existing constructions of anonymous credentials: U-Prove and Idemix. We show that the performance of the new schemes is competitive with U-Prove (which is not provably secure, whereas ours is based on DDH), and many times faster than Idemix.},

While decentralized identity promises to give users greater control over their private data, it burdens users with management of private keys, creating a significant risk of key loss. Existing and proposed approaches also presume the spontaneous availability of a credential-issuance ecosystem, creating a bootstrapping problem. They also omit essential functionality, like resistance to Sybil attacks and the ability to detect misbehaving or sanctioned users while preserving user privacy.

CanDID addresses these challenges by issuing credentials in a user-friendly way that draws securely and privately on data from existing, unmodified web service providers. Such legacy compatibility similarly enables CanDID users to leverage their existing online accounts for recovery of lost keys. Using a decentralized committee of nodes, CanDID provides strong confidentiality for user's keys, real-world identities, and data, yet prevents users from spawning multiple identities and allows identification (and blacklisting) of sanctioned users.

We present the CanDID architecture and its technical innovations and report on experiments demonstrating its practical performance.},

PAPR credentials simultaneously provide conditional user privacy and auditable privacy revocation. The ﬁrst property implies that users keep their identity private when authenticating unless and until an appointed authority requests to revoke this privacy, retroactively. The second property enforces that auditors can verify whether or not this authority has revoked privacy from an issued credential (i.e. learned the identity of the user who owns that credential), holding the authority accountable. In other words, the second property enriches conditionally anonymous credential systems with transparency by design, eﬀectively discouraging such systems from being used for mass surveillance. In this work, we introduce the notion of a PAPR anonymous credential scheme, formalize it as an ideal functionality, and present constructions that are provably secure under standard assumptions in the Universal Composability framework. The core tool in our PAPR construction is a mechanism for randomly selecting an anonymous committee which users secret share their identity information towards, while hiding the identities of the committee members from the authority. As a consequence, in order to initiate the revocation process for a given credential, the authority is forced to post a request on a public bulletin board used as a broadcast channel to contact the anonymous committee that holds the keys needed to decrypt the identity connected to the credential. This mechanism makes the user de-anonymization publicly auditable.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new cryptographic primitive, called Sybil-Resilient Anonymous (SyRA) signature, which enables users to generate, on demand, unlinkable pseudonyms tied to any given context, and issue digital signatures on their behalf. Concretely, given a personhood relation, an issuer (who may be a distributed entity) enables users to prove their personhood and extract an associated long-term key, which can then be used to issue signatures for any given context and message. Sybil-resilient anonymous signatures achieve two key security properties: 1) Sybil resilience: ensures that every user is entitled to at most one pseudonym per context, and 2) anonymity: requires that no information about the user is leaked through their various pseudonyms or the signatures they issue on their pseudonyms’ behalf. We conceptualize SyRA signatures as an ideal functionality in the Universal Composition (UC) setting and realize the functionality via an efficient, pairing-based construction that utilizes two levels of verifiable random functions (VRFs) and which may be of independent interest. A key feature of this approach is the statelessness of the issuer: we achieve the core properties of Sybil resilience and anonymity without requiring the issuer to retain any information about past user interactions. SyRA signatures have various applications in multiparty systems, such as e-voting (e.g., for decentralized governance) and cryptocurrency airdrops, making them an attractive option for deployment in decentralized identity (DID) systems.},

In a normal situation, signers are allowed to prove their possession of attributes of credentials anonymously and in a user-controllable way. The proof can demonstrate that certified claims hold with a desired privacy level, such as proving that age is within a certain value or a pre-defined range. However, in case of misbehaviors or for accountability, the identity of a signer can be revealed or signatures can be anonymously linked using opening and linking keys, respectively. The proposed scheme is designed to work for dynamic credential management allowing for the issuance of new credentials and proper revocation. To prove the security of the proposed anonymous credential scheme, we first define a security model to capture basic properties, anonymity, traceability, non-frameability, and controllable unlinkability. We then demonstrate that it satisfies all these properties under the standard assumption, i.e., q-strong Diffie-Hellman assumption in the random oracle model. Finally we provide a performance analysis of our scheme in terms of signature size and basic signing and verifying operations. Additionally, we present empirical results to show that the performance of our scheme is reasonably efficient.},

	title = {Quantum {Algorithms} for {Linear} {Algebra} and {Optimization}},
	abstract = {Quantum computing utilizes the incomprehensible laws of quantum mechanics for performing calculations in fundamentally different ways from classical computers. Machine learning is one of the most actively researched and applied fields, and quantum computing has strong potential in providing machine learning with previously unimaginable computational power. Quantum machine learning is a symbiosis of two of the most promising fields of science and engineering. There are four fundamentally different approaches to quantum machine learning, as described in section (0.3). This thesis is focused on learning quantum data on a quantum computer (the QQ approach).

Chapter (1) introduces most relevant concepts in quantum information and computation, which are crucial for understanding the quantum polar decomposition algorithm in chapter (2) and its applications in chapter (3).

The quantum polar decomposition algorithm is a generalization of the quantum algorithm for linear systems of equations found in subsection (1.3.4), which strongly relies on quantum phase estimation in subsection (1.3.3) and the quantum Fourier transform from subsection (1.3.2).

The polar decomposition of a matrix is A = UB, where U is a unitary matrix, and B is a positive Hermitian matrix. One can use it for performing U, exp(-iBt) and exp(-iBt) in a deterministic way. The algorithm's complexity is O(kappa), where kappa is the condition number of the matrix A.

Polar decomposition has several potential applications which are discussed in more detail in chapter (3). The most interesting application is learning quantum unitary transformations from quantum input/output data, as described in section (3.1).

Learning how to perform a quantum unitary transformation from quantum data can be very useful. For example, properties of a system described by an unknown Hamiltonian H can be learned by generating a set of initial quantum states and allowing them to dynamically evolve within the system for a fixed time t. The input/output pairs can then be used as input for learning the transformation U=exp(-iH/hbar) generated by the Hamiltonian.},

	abstract = {Current architectures to validate, certify, and manage identity are based on centralized, top-down approaches that rely on trusted authorities and third-party operators. We approach the problem of digital identity starting from a human rights perspective, with a primary focus on identity systems in the developed world. We assert that individual persons must be allowed to manage their personal information in a multitude of different ways in different contexts and that to do so, each individual must be able to create multiple unrelated identities. Therefore, we ﬁrst deﬁne a set of fundamental constraints that digital identity systems must satisfy to preserve and promote privacy as required for individual autonomy. With these constraints in mind, we then propose a decentralized, standards-based approach, using a combination of distributed ledger technology and thoughtful regulation, to facilitate many-to-many relationships among providers of key services. Our proposal for digital identity differs from others in its approach to trust in that we do not seek to bind credentials to each other or to a mutually trusted authority to achieve strong non-transferability. Because the system does not implicitly encourage its users to maintain a single aggregated identity that can potentially be constrained or reconstructed against their interests, individuals and organizations are free to embrace the system and share in its beneﬁts.},

	abstract = {The history of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict traces back to the late 19th century when Zionists sought to establish a homeland for the Jewish people in Ottoman-controlled Palestine, a region roughly corresponding to the Land of Israel in Jewish tradition. The Balfour Declaration of 1917, issued by the British government, endorsed the idea of a Jewish homeland in Palestine, which led to an influx of Jewish immigrants to the region. Following World War II and the Holocaust, international pressure mounted for the establishment of a Jewish state in Palestine, leading to the creation of Israel in 1948.
The establishment of Israel, and the war that followed and preceded it, led to the displacement of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians who became refugees, sparking a decades-long conflict between Israel and the Palestinian people. The Palestinians seek to establish their own independent state in at least one part of historic Palestine. Israeli defense of its own borders, control over the West Bank, the Egyptian-Israeli blockade of the Gaza Strip, and Palestinian internal politics currently make the Palestinians' goal out of reach.
Numerous peace negotiations have taken place over the years, but a long-term peace agreement has not been reached. The conflict has been marked by violence, including terrorist attacks by Palestinian militants and military operations by Israel. The United States and other countries have played a key role in attempting to broker peace, but many obstacles remain, including the issue of Israeli settlements in the West Bank, the status of Jerusalem, and the ultimate fate of Palestinian refugees.},

	abstract = {The Israeli–Palestinian conflict is an ongoing military and political conflict in the Levant. Beginning in the mid-20th century, it is one of the world's longest-continuing conflicts. Key areas of the conflict include the Israeli occupation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip, the status of Jerusalem, Israeli settlements, borders, security and water rights, as well as Palestinian freedom of movement and the Palestinian right of return.
The conflict has its origins in the arrival of Jewish immigrants to Palestine in the late 19th and 20th centuries and the development of the ideology of Zionism. The local Arab population opposed Zionism, primarily out of fear of territorial displacement and dispossession. The Zionist movement garnered the support of an imperial power in the 1917 Balfour Declaration issued by Britain, which promised to support the creation of a "Jewish homeland in Palestine". Following World War I, Mandatory Palestine was established, and tensions grew into open sectarian conflict between Jews and Arabs. In 1936, an Arab revolt erupted demanding independence, which the British suppressed.The 1947 United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine dividing Mandatory Palestine between a Jewish and an Arab state triggered the 1948 Palestine war, which saw the expulsion and flight of most Palestinian Arabs, the establishment of an independent Israel on most of the Mandate's territory, and the occupations of the Gaza Strip and the West Bank by Egypt and Jordan, respectively. In the 1967 Six-Day War, Israel occupied the West Bank and the Gaza Strip (now known as the Palestinian territories), which is now considered to be the longest military occupation in modern history, and has drawn international condemnation for violating the human rights of the Palestinians.The conflict has claimed many civilian casualties, mostly Palestinian, since its inception. Various attempts have been made to resolve the conflict as part of the Israeli–Palestinian peace process, alongside efforts to resolve the broader Arab–Israeli conflict. Progress towards a negotiated solution between the Israeli government and the Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) was made with the Oslo Accords of 1993–1995. The majority of recent peace efforts have been centred around the two-state solution, which involves the establishment of an independent Palestinian state alongside Israel. Public support for a two-state solution, which formerly enjoyed support from both Israeli Jews and Palestinians, has dwindled in recent years. Official negotiations are mediated by the Quartet on the Middle East, which consists of the United Nations, the United States, Russia, and the European Union. The Arab League, which has proposed the Arab Peace Initiative, is another important actor, along with Egypt and Jordan. Since 2006, the Palestinian side has been split between Fatah dominating the Palestinian Authority in the West Bank and Hamas that gained control of the Gaza Strip. Attempts to remedy this have been repeated and continuing. Since 2019, the Israeli side has also been experiencing political crisis. The latest round of peace negotiations began in July 2013 but were suspended in 2014. Since 2006, Hamas and Israel have fought five wars, the most recent of which began in 2023 and is ongoing as of February 2024.},

	abstract = {Christianity () is an Abrahamic monotheistic religion based on the life and teachings of Jesus. It is the world's largest and most widespread religion with roughly 2.4 billion followers, comprising around 31.2\% of the world population. Its adherents, known as Christians, are estimated to make up a majority of the population in 157 countries and territories. Christians believe that Jesus is the Son of God, whose coming as the Messiah was prophesied in the Hebrew Bible (called the Old Testament in Christianity) and chronicled in the New Testament.
Christianity remains culturally diverse in its Western and Eastern branches, and doctrinally diverse concerning justification and the nature of salvation, ecclesiology, ordination, and Christology. The creeds of various Christian denominations generally hold in common Jesus as the Son of God—the Logos incarnated—who ministered, suffered, and died on a cross, but rose from the dead for the salvation of humankind; and referred to as the gospel, meaning the "good news". The four canonical gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke and John describe Jesus's life and teachings, with the Old Testament as the gospels' respected background.
Christianity began in the 1st century after the birth of Jesus as a Judaic sect with Hellenistic influence, in the Roman province of Judea. The disciples of Jesus spread their faith around the Eastern Mediterranean area, despite significant persecution. The inclusion of Gentiles led Christianity to slowly separate from Judaism (2nd century). Emperor Constantine I decriminalized Christianity in the Roman Empire by the Edict of Milan (313), later convening the Council of Nicaea (325) where Early Christianity was consolidated into what would become the state religion of the Roman Empire (380). The Church of the East and Oriental Orthodoxy both split over differences in Christology (5th century), while the Eastern Orthodox Church and the Catholic Church separated in the East–West Schism (1054). Protestantism split into numerous denominations from the Catholic Church in the Reformation era (16th century). Following the Age of Discovery (15th–17th century), Christianity expanded throughout the world via missionary work, extensive trade and colonialism. Christianity played a prominent role in the development of Western civilization, particularly in Europe from late antiquity and the Middle Ages.The six major branches of Christianity are Roman Catholicism (1.3 billion people), Protestantism (900 million), Eastern Orthodoxy (220 million), Oriental Orthodoxy (60 million), Restorationism (35 million), and the Church of the East (600 thousand). Smaller church communities number in the thousands despite efforts toward unity (ecumenism). In the West, Christianity remains the dominant religion even with a decline in adherence, with about 70\% of that population identifying as Christian. Christianity is growing in Africa and Asia, the world's most populous continents. Christians remain greatly persecuted in many regions of the world, particularly in the Middle East, North Africa, East Asia, and South Asia.},

	abstract = {Judaism (Hebrew: יַהֲדוּת‎ Yahăḏūṯ) is an Abrahamic, monotheistic, and widely an ethnic religion. It comprises the collective spiritual, cultural, and legal traditions of the Jewish people, having originated as an organized religion in the Middle East during the Bronze Age. Contemporary Judaism evolved from Yahwism, the cultic religious movement of ancient Israel and Judah, around the 6th/5th century BCE, and is thus considered to be one of the oldest monotheistic religions. Religious Jews regard Judaism as their means of observing the Mosaic covenant, which was established between God and the Israelites, their ancestors. Along with the Samaritanism, Judaism is one of the two oldest Abrahamic religions.
Jewish religious doctrine encompasses a wide body of texts, practices, theological positions, and forms of organization. Among Judaism's core texts is the Torah, the first five books of the Tanakh, a collection of ancient Hebrew scriptures. The Tanakh, known in English as the Hebrew Bible, is also referred to as the "Old Testament" in Christianity. In addition to the original written scripture, the supplemental Oral Torah is represented by later texts, such as the Midrash and the Talmud. The Hebrew-language word torah can mean "teaching", "law", or "instruction", although "Torah" can also be used as a general term that refers to any Jewish text that expands or elaborates on the original Five Books of Moses. Representing the core of the Jewish spiritual and religious tradition, the Torah is a term and a set of teachings that are explicitly self-positioned as encompassing at least seventy, and potentially infinite, facets and interpretations. Judaism's texts, traditions, and values strongly influenced later Abrahamic religions, including Christianity and Islam. Hebraism, like Hellenism, played a seminal role in the formation of Western civilization through its impact as a core background element of Early Christianity.Within Judaism, there are a variety of religious movements, most of which emerged from Rabbinic Judaism, which holds that God revealed his laws and commandments to Moses on Mount Sinai in the form of both the Written and Oral Torah. Historically, all or part of this assertion was challenged by various groups such as the Sadducees and Hellenistic Judaism during the Second Temple period; the Karaites during the early and later medieval period; and among segments of the modern non-Orthodox denominations. Some modern branches of Judaism such as Humanistic Judaism may be considered secular or nontheistic. Today, the largest Jewish religious movements are Orthodox Judaism (Haredi and Modern Orthodox), Conservative Judaism, and Reform Judaism. Major sources of difference between these groups are their approaches to halakha (Jewish law), the authority of the rabbinic tradition, and the significance of the State of Israel. Orthodox Judaism maintains that the Torah and halakha are divine in origin, eternal and unalterable, and that they should be strictly followed. Conservative and Reform Judaism are more liberal, with Conservative Judaism generally promoting a more traditionalist interpretation of Judaism's requirements than Reform Judaism. A typical Reform position is that halakha should be viewed as a set of general guidelines rather than as a set of restrictions and obligations whose observance is required of all Jews. Historically, special courts enforced halakha; today, these courts still exist but the practice of Judaism is mostly voluntary. Authority on theological and legal matters is not vested in any one person or organization, but in the sacred texts and the rabbis and scholars who interpret them.
Jews are an ethnoreligious group including those born Jewish (or "ethnic Jews"), in addition to converts to Judaism. In 2021, the world Jewish population was estimated at 15.2 million, or roughly 0.195\% of the total world population, although religious observance varies from strict to none. In 2021, about 45.6\% of all Jews resided in Israel and another 42.1\% resided in the United States and Canada, with most of the remainder living in Europe, and other groups spread throughout Latin America, Asia, Africa, and Australia.},

	abstract = {Current implementations of differentially-private (DP) systems either lack support to track the global privacy budget consumed on a dataset, or fail to faithfully maintain the state continuity of this budget. We show that failure to maintain a privacy budget enables an adversary to mount replay, rollback and fork attacks - obtaining answers to many more queries than what a secure system would allow. As a result the attacker can reconstruct secret data that DP aims to protect - even if DP code runs in a Trusted Execution Environment (TEE). We propose ElephantDP, a system that aims to provide the same guarantees as a trusted curator in the global DP model would, albeit set in an untrusted environment. Our system relies on a state continuity module to provide protection for the privacy budget and a TEE to faithfully execute DP code and update the budget. To provide security, our protocol makes several design choices including the content of the persistent state and the order between budget updates and query answers. We prove that ElephantDP provides liveness (i.e., the protocol can restart from a correct state and respond to queries as long as the budget is not exceeded) and DP confidentiality (i.e., an attacker learns about a dataset as much as it would from interacting with a trusted curator). Our implementation and evaluation of the protocol use Intel SGX as a TEE to run the DP code and a network of TEEs to maintain state continuity. Compared to an insecure baseline, we observe only 1.1-2\${\textbackslash}times\$ overheads and lower relative overheads for larger datasets and complex DP queries.},

	abstract = {Managing identity across an ever-growing digital services landscape has become one of the most challenging tasks for security experts. Over the years, several Identity Management (IDM) systems were introduced and adopted to tackle with the growing demand of an identity. In this series, a recently emerging IDM system is Self-Sovereign Identity (SSI) which offers greater control and access to users regarding their identity. This distinctive feature of the SSI IDM system represents a major development towards the availability of sovereign identity to users. uPort is an emerging open-source identity management system providing sovereign identity to users, organisations, and other entities. As an emerging identity management system, it requires meticulous analysis of its architecture, working, operational services, efﬁciency, advantages and limitations. Therefore, this paper contributes towards achieving all of these objectives. Firstly, it presents the architecture and working of the uPort identity management system. Secondly, it develops a Decentralized Application (DApp) to demonstrate and evaluate its operational services and efﬁciency. Finally, based on the developed DApp and experimental analysis, it presents the advantages and limitations of the uPort identity management system.},

	abstract = {Digital identity is the phrase referring to the data that computer systems use to represent external agents, which can be individuals, organizations, applications, or devices. For individuals, it involves an aggregation of personal data that is essential for facilitating automated access to digital services, confirming one's identity on the internet, and allowing digital systems to manage interactions between different parties. It is a component of a person's social identity in the digital realm, often referred to as their online identity.
The scope of digital identities encompasses the full range of data produced through an individual's activities on the internet. This data set may include user credentials like usernames and passwords, search histories, dates of birth, social security numbers, and records of online purchases. When such personal information is accessible in the public domain, it can be utilized by others to piece together a person's offline identity. Furthermore, this information can be compiled to construct a "data double"—a comprehensive profile created from a person's scattered digital footprints across various platforms. These profiles are instrumental in enabling personalized experiences on the internet and within different digital services.Should the exchange of personal data for online content and services become a practice of the past, an alternative transactional model must emerge. As the internet becomes more attuned to privacy concerns, media publishers, application developers, and online retailers are re-evaluating their strategies, sometimes reinventing their business models completely. Increasingly, the trend is shifting towards monetizing online offerings directly, with users being asked to pay for access through subscriptions and other forms of payment, moving away from the reliance on collecting personal data.Navigating the legal and societal implications of digital identity is intricate and fraught with challenges. Misrepresenting one's legal identity in the digital realm can pose numerous threats to a society increasingly reliant on digital interactions, opening doors for various illicit activities. Criminals, fraudsters, and terrorists might exploit these vulnerabilities to perpetrate offenses that can affect the virtual domain, the physical world, or both..},

IdM systems fall under the overarching umbrellas of IT security and data management. Identity and access management systems not only identify, authenticate, and control access for individuals who will be utilizing IT resources but also the hardware and applications employees need to access.IdM addresses the need to ensure appropriate access to resources across increasingly heterogeneous technology environments and to meet increasingly rigorous compliance requirements.The terms "identity management" (IdM) and "identity and access management" are used interchangeably in the area of identity access management.Identity-management systems, products, applications and platforms manage identifying and ancillary data about entities that include individuals, computer-related hardware, and software applications.
IdM covers issues such as how users gain an identity, the roles, and sometimes the permissions that identity grants, the protection of that identity, and the technologies supporting that protection (e.g., network protocols, digital certificates, passwords, etc.).},

	abstract = {In the classical model of computation, it is well established that one-way functions (OWF) are minimal for computational cryptography: They are essential for almost any cryptographic application that cannot be realized with respect to computationally unbounded adversaries. In the quantum setting, however, OWFs appear not to be essential (Kretschmer 2021; Ananth et al., Morimae and Yamakawa 2022), and the question of whether such a minimal primitive exists remains open.

We consider EFI pairs — efficiently samplable, statistically far but computationally indistinguishable pairs of (mixed) quantum states. Building on the work of Yan (2022), which shows equivalence between EFI pairs and statistical commitment schemes, we show that EFI pairs are necessary for a large class of quantum-cryptographic applications. Specifically, we construct EFI pairs from minimalistic versions of commitments schemes, oblivious transfer, and general secure multiparty computation, as well as from 𝖰𝖢𝖹𝖪 proofs from essentially any non-trivial language. We also construct quantum computational zero knowledge (𝖰𝖢𝖹𝖪) proofs for all of 𝖰𝖨𝖯 from any EFI pair.

This suggests that, for much of quantum cryptography, EFI pairs play a similar role to that played by OWFs in the classical setting: they are simple to describe, essential, and also serve as a linchpin for demonstrating equivalence between primitives.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2009/050},
	abstract = {The notion of Zero Knowledge Proofs (of knowledge) [ZKP] is central to
cryptography; it provides a set of security properties that proved
indispensable in concrete protocol design. These properties are defined for any given input and also for any auxiliary verifier private state, as they are aimed at any use of the
protocol as a subroutine in a bigger application.
Many times, however, moving the theoretical notion to
practical designs has been quite problematic. This is due to the fact
that the most efficient protocols fail to provide the above ZKP
properties \{{\textbackslash}em for all\} possible inputs and verifier states.
This situation has created various problems to protocol designers who
have often either introduced imperfect protocols with mistakes or with
lack of security arguments, or they have been forced to use much less
efficient protocols in order to achieve the required properties. In
this work we address this issue by introducing the notion of
``protocol portability,'' a property that identifies input and
verifier state distributions under which a protocol becomes a ZKP when
called as a subroutine in a sequential execution of a larger
application. We then concentrate on the very efficient and heavily employed
``Generalized Schnorr Proofs'' (GSP) and identify the portability of
such protocols. We also point to previous protocol weaknesses and
errors that have been made in numerous applications throughout the
years, due to employment of GSP instances while lacking the notion of
portability (primarily in the case of unknown order groups). This
demonstrates that cryptographic application designers who care about
efficiency need to consider our notion carefully.
We provide a compact specification language for GSP protocols that
protocol designers can employ. Our specification language is
consistent with the ad-hoc notation that is currently widely used and it
offers automatic derivation of the proof protocol while dictating
its portability (i.e., the proper initial state and inputs) and
its security guarantees. Thus, our language specifications can be used modularly in
designs and proofs. This assures that the protocol implementation can
indeed be used as a subroutine that is ZKP in its context.
Finally, as a second alternative to designers wishing to use GSPs, we
present a modification of GSP protocols that is unconditionally
portable (i.e., ZKP) and is still quite efficient. Our constructions
are the first such protocols proven secure in the standard model
(while the previously known efficient constructions relied on the
Random Oracle model).},

The generation and use of authentication credentials are asynchronous, allowing users to sign on when identity providers are temporarily unavailable. We evaluate EL PASSO in a distributed environment and prove its low computational cost, yielding faster sign-on operations than OIDC from a regular laptop, one-second user-perceived latency from a low-power device, and scaling to more than 50 sign-on operations per second at a relying party using a single 4-core server in the cloud.},

At the same time, it is infeasible to ﬁnd a witness for a value that was not accumulated. We put forward the notion of a dynamic accumulator, which is an accumulator that allows one to dynamically add and delete inputs, such that the cost of an add or delete is independent of the number of accumulated values. We achieve this under the strong RSA assumption. For this construction, we also show an efﬁcient zero-knowledge protocol for proving that a committed value is in the accumulator.},

Our main claim is that the task of ﬁnding attacks is fundamentally different from these other applications, making it signiﬁcantly harder for the intrusion detection community to employ machine learning effectively.

	abstract = {Privacy is a huge concern for cryptocurrencies and blockchains as most of these systems log everything in the clear. This has resulted in several academic and industrial initiatives to address privacy. Starting with the UTXO model of Bitcoin, initial works brought confidentiality and anonymity to payments. Recent works have expanded to support more generalized forms of private computation. Such solutions tend to be highly involved as they rely on advanced cryptographic primitives and creative techniques to handle issues related to dealing with private records (e.g. concurrency and double spending). This situation makes it hard to comprehend the current state-of-the-art, much less build on top of it.

To address these challenges, we develop a systematization of knowledge for privacy-preserving solutions in blockchain. To the best of our knowledge, our work is the first of its kind. After motivating design challenges, we devise two systematization frameworks---the first as a stepping stone to the second---and use them to study the state-of-the-art. For our first framework, we study the zero-knowledge proof systems used in surveyed solutions, based on their key features and limitations. Our second is for blockchain privacy-preserving solutions; we define several dimensions to categorize the surveyed schemes and, in doing so, identify two major paradigms employed to achieve private computation. We go on to provide insights to guide solutions' adoption and development. Finally, we touch upon challenges related to limited functionality, practicality, and accommodating new developments.},

In the non-interactive setting, the most common protocols include blind, ring, and group signatures, each of which has been the subject of enormous research in the security and cryptography literature. These primitives are now being deployed at scale in major applications, including Intel's SGX software attestation framework.

They have been extensively used to develop anonymous credentials schemes and to achieve an even more comprehensive range of functionalities in the decentralized web.

Substantial work has been done to formalize different types of signatures where an allowable set of transformations can be applied to message-signature pairs to obtain new related pairs. Most of the previous work focused on transformations with respect to the message being signed, but little has been done to study what happens when transformations apply to the signing keys. A first attempt to thoroughly formalize such aspects was carried by Derler and Slamanig (ePrint '16, Designs, Codes and Cryptography '19), followed by the more recent efforts by Backes et. al (ASIACRYPT '18) and Eaton et. al (ePrint '23). However, the literature on the topic is vast and different terminology is used across contributions, which makes it difficult to compare related works and understand the range of applications covered by a given construction.

In this work, we present a unified view of signatures with randomizable keys and revisit their security properties. We focus on state-of-the-art constructions and related applications, identifying existing challenges.

	abstract = {Identity resolution is crucial for law enforcement agencies globally and a difﬁcult task to match the real-world identity in big data due to data inconsistency e.g. typographical errors, naming variation, and abbreviations. The fuzzy approach to identity resolution has been introduced that uses Soundex and JaroWinkler distance algorithms in a cascaded manner to calculate an aggregate score for the full name. While the Edit-distance algorithm is used to score the address and ethnicity description attributes. The Soundex code has been modiﬁed to numbers only with increased code length to 6-digits for this fuzzy approach. This allowed the matching algorithm to overcome some of the Soundex code limitations of name matching. The approach accommodates three different variations of name for an iterative search process that retrieves matched records based on inputs. In the experiment, searching for a suspect in two different cases, the initial search retrieved 173 and 52 records for each target suspect. These records were grouped using the Mean-Shift clustering technique based on the similarity score of three attributes. For further analysis, the segmentation process of records matched 16 and 22 records for each case respectively, and graph analysis matched the target suspect identity out of other matched identities with links association to different addresses. The overall matching performance of this fuzzy approach is encouraging, and it can beneﬁt law enforcement agencies to speed up the investigation process and most importantly can help to identify the suspect with even minimal information available.},

	abstract = {We present a much-improved practical protocol, based on the hardness of Module-SIS and Module-LWE problems, for proving knowledge of a short vector \$s\$ satisfying \$As=t{\textbackslash}bmod q\$. The currently most-efficient technique for constructing such a proof works by showing that the \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ norm of \$s\$ is small. It creates a commitment to a polynomial vector \$m\$ whose CRT coefficients are the coefficients of \$s\$ and then shows that (1) \$A{\textbackslash}cdot {\textbackslash}mathsf\{CRT\}(m)=t{\textbackslash}bmod{\textbackslash},q\$ and (2) in the case that we want to prove that the \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ norm is at most \$1\$, the polynomial product \$(m - 1){\textbackslash}cdot m{\textbackslash}cdot(m+1)\$ equals to \$0\$. While these schemes are already quite good for practical applications, the requirement of using the CRT embedding and only being naturally adapted to proving the \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$-norm, somewhat hinders the efficiency of this approach.

In this work, we show that there is a more direct and more efficient way to prove that the coefficients of \$s\$ have a small \${\textbackslash}ell\_2\$ norm which does not require an equivocation with the \${\textbackslash}ell\_{\textbackslash}infty\$ norm, nor any conversion to the CRT representation. We observe that the inner product between two vectors \$ r\$ and \$s\$ can be made to appear as a coefficient of a product (or sum of products) between polynomials which are functions of \$r\$ and \$s\$. Thus, by using a polynomial product proof system and hiding all but one coefficient, we are able to prove knowledge of the inner product of two vectors modulo \$q\$. Using a cheap, approximate range proof, one can then lift the proof to be over \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\$ instead of \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}\_q\$. Our protocols for proving short norms work over all (interesting) polynomial rings, but are particularly efficient for rings like \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{Z\}[X]/(X{\textasciicircum}n+1)\$ in which the function relating the inner product of vectors and polynomial products happens to be a ``nice'' automorphism.

The new proof system can be plugged into constructions of various lattice-based privacy primitives in a black-box manner. As examples, we instantiate a verifiable encryption scheme and a group signature scheme which are more than twice as compact as the previously best solutions.},

	abstract = {The existence of succinct non-interactive arguments for NP (i.e.,
non-interactive computationally-sound proofs where the verifier's
work is essentially independent of the complexity of the NP
nondeterministic verifier) has been an intriguing question for the
past two decades. Other than CS proofs in the random oracle model
[Micali, FOCS '94], the only existing candidate construction is
based on an elaborate assumption that is tailored to a specific
protocol [Di Crescenzo and Lipmaa, CiE '08].

We formulate a general and relatively natural notion of an
{\textbackslash}emph\{extractable collision-resistant hash function (ECRH)\} and show
that, if ECRHs exist, then a modified version of Di Crescenzo and
Lipmaa's protocol is a succinct non-interactive argument for
NP. Furthermore, the modified protocol is actually a succinct
non-interactive {\textbackslash}emph\{adaptive argument of knowledge (SNARK).\} We
then propose several candidate constructions for ECRHs and
relaxations thereof.

We demonstrate the applicability of SNARKs to various forms of delegation of computation, to succinct non-interactive zero knowledge arguments, and to succinct two-party secure computation. Finally, we show that SNARKs essentially imply the existence of ECRHs, thus demonstrating the necessity of the assumption.

Going beyond \${\textbackslash}ECRH\$s, we formulate the notion of \{\vphantom{\}}{\textbackslash}em extractable
one-way functions (\${\textbackslash}EOWF\$s)\vphantom{\{}\}. Assuming the existence of a natural
variant of \${\textbackslash}EOWF\$s, we construct a \$2\$-message
selective-opening-attack secure commitment scheme and a 3-round
zero-knowledge argument of knowledge. Furthermore, if the \${\textbackslash}EOWF\$s are
concurrently extractable, the 3-round zero-knowledge protocol is also
concurrent zero-knowledge.

Our constructions circumvent previous black-box impossibility
results regarding these protocols by relying on \${\textbackslash}EOWF\$s as the non-black-box component in the security reductions.},

In this work, we identify flaws in security proofs of a number of qSDH-based DAA schemes and point out that none of the proposed schemes can be proven secure in the recent model by Camenisch et al.{\textasciitilde}(PKC 2016). We therefore present a new, provably secure DAA scheme that is based on the qSDH assumption. The new scheme is one of the most efficient DAA schemes, with support for DAA extensions to signature-based revocation and attributes. We rigorously prove the scheme secure in the model of Camenisch et al., which we modify to support the extensions. As a side-result of independent interest, we prove that the BBS+ signature scheme is secure in the type-3 pairing setting, allowing for our scheme to be used with the most efficient pairing-friendly curves.},

	abstract = {BBS signatures were implicitly proposed by Boneh, Boyen, and Shacham (CRYPTO ’04) as part of their group signature scheme, and explicitly cast as stand-alone signatures by Camenisch and Lysyanskaya (CRYPTO ’04). A provably secure version, called BBS+, was then devised by Au, Susilo, and Mu (SCN ’06), and is currently the object of a standardization effort which has led to a recent RFC draft. BBS+ signatures are suitable for use within anonymous credential and DAA systems, as their algebraic structure enables efficient proofs of knowledge of message-signature pairs that support partial disclosure.

BBS+ signatures consist of one group element and two scalars. As our first contribution, we prove that a variant of BBS+ producing shorter signatures, consisting only of one group element and one scalar, is also secure. The resulting scheme is essentially the original BBS proposal, which was lacking a proof of security. Here we show it satisfies, under the q-SDH assumption, the same provable security guarantees as BBS+. We also provide a complementary tight analysis in the algebraic group model, which heuristically justifies instantiations with potentially shorter signatures.

Furthermore, we devise simplified and shorter zero-knowledge proofs of knowledge of a BBS message-signature pair that support partial disclosure of the message. Over the BLS12-381 curve, our proofs are 896 bits shorter than the prior proposal by Camenisch, Drijvers, and Lehmann (TRUST ’16), which is also adopted by the RFC draft.

Finally, we show that BBS satisfies one-more unforgeability in the algebraic group model in a scenario, arising in the context of credentials, where the signer can be asked to sign arbitrary group elements, meant to be commitments, without seeing their openings.},

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2019/142},
	abstract = {We study the problem of building SNARKs modularly by linking small specialized “proof gadgets" SNARKs in a lightweight manner.
Our motivation is both theoretical and practical. On the theoretical side, modular SNARK designs would be flexible and reusable.
In practice, specialized SNARKs have the potential to be more efficient than general-purpose schemes, on which most existing works have focused. If a computation naturally presents different “components" (e.g. one arithmetic circuit and one boolean circuit), a general-purpose scheme would homogenize them to a single representation with a subsequent cost in performance. Through a modular approach one could instead exploit the nuances of a computation and choose the best gadget for each component.

Our contribution is LegoSNARK, a "toolbox" (or framework) for commit-and-prove zkSNARKs (CP-SNARKs) that includes:

1) General composition tools: build new CP-SNARKs from proof gadgets for basic relations \${\textbackslash}mathit\{simply\}\$.

2) A "lifting" tool: add commit-and-prove capabilities to a broad class of existing zkSNARKs \${\textbackslash}mathit\{efficiently\}\$. This makes them interoperable (linkable) within the same computation. For example, one QAP-based scheme can be used prove one component; another GKR-based scheme can be used to prove another.

3) A collection of succinct proof gadgets for a variety of relations.

Additionally, through our framework and gadgets, we are able to obtain new succinct proof systems. Notably:

– \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{LegoGro16\}\$, a commit-and-prove version of Groth16 zkSNARK, that operates over data committed with a classical Pedersen vector commitment, and that achieves a 5000\${\textbackslash}times\$ speed in proving time.

– \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{LegoUAC\}\$, a pairing-based SNARK for arithmetic circuits that has a universal, circuit-independent, CRS, and proving time linear in the number of circuit gates (vs. the recent scheme of Groth et al. (CRYPTO'18) with quadratic CRS and quasilinear proving time).

– CP-SNARKs for matrix multiplication that achieve optimal proving complexity.

4) A codebase written in C\${\textbackslash}mathsf\{++\}\$ for highly composable zkSNARKs with commit-and-prove capabilities\${\textasciicircum}*\$.

Although a common problem, there is no common understanding of interoperability in the context of self-sovereign identities. In this tutorial paper, we propose a definition of interoperability of self-sovereign identities to enable a shared understanding. Moreover, due to the decentralized nature, interoperability of self-sovereign identities depends on multiple components, such as ones responsible for establishing a cryptographic trust or enabling secure communication between entities without centralized authorities. To understand those components and their dependencies, we also present a reference model that maps the required components and considerations that build up a self-sovereign identity implementation.

	abstract = {Cryptographic applications often require proving statements about hidden secrets satisfying certain circuit relations. Moreover, these proofs must often be generated obliviously, i.e., without knowledge of the secret. This work presents a new technique called --- FRI on hidden values --- for efficiently proving such statements. 
This technique enables a polynomial commitment scheme for values hidden inside linearly homomorphic primitives, such as linearly homomorphic encryption, linearly homomorphic commitment, group exponentiation, fully homomorphic encryption, etc. 
Building on this technique, we obtain the following results.

1. An efficient SNARK for proving the honest evaluation of FHE ciphertexts. This allows for an efficiently verifiable private delegation of computation, where the client only needs to perform logarithmic many FHE computations to verify the correctness of the computation.

2. An efficient approach for privately delegating the computation of zkSNARKs to a single untrusted server, without making any non-black-box use of cryptography. All prior works require multiple servers and the assumption that some subset of the servers are honest.

3. A weighted threshold signature scheme that does not require any setup. In particular, parties may sample their own keys independently, and no distributed key generation (DKG) protocol is needed. Furthermore, the efficiency of our scheme is completely independent of the weights. 

Prior to this work, there were no known black-box feasibility results for any of these applications. We also investigate the use of this approach in the context of public proof aggregation. These are only a few representative applications that we explore in this paper. We expect our techniques to be widely applicable in many other scenarios.},

	abstract = {Frequently, users on the web need to show that they are, for example, not a robot, old enough to access an age restricted video, or eligible to download an ebook from their local public library without being tracked. Anonymous credentials were developed to address these concerns. However, existing schemes do not handle the realities of deployment or the complexities of real-world identity. Instead, they implicitly make assumptions such as there being an issuing authority for anonymous credentials that, for real applications, requires the local department of motor vehicles to issue sophisticated cryptographic tokens to show users are over 18. In reality, there are multiple trust sources for a given identity attribute, their credentials have distinctively different formats, and many, if not all, issuers are unwilling to adopt new protocols.

We present and build zk-creds, a protocol that uses general-purpose zero-knowledge proofs to 1) remove the need for credential issuers to hold signing keys: credentials can be issued to a bulletin board instantiated as a transparency log, Byzantine system, or even a blockchain; 2) convert existing identity documents into anonymous credentials without modifying documents or coordinating with their issuing authority; 3) allow for flexible, composable, and complex identity statements over multiple credentials. Concretely, identity assertions using zk-creds take less than 150ms in a real-world scenario of using a passport to anonymously access age-restricted videos.},

	abstract = {Sigma protocols are one of the most common and efficient zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). Over the decades, a large number of Sigma protocols are proposed, yet few works pay attention to the common design principal. In this work, we propose a generic framework of Sigma protocols for algebraic statements from verifiable secret sharing (VSS) schemes. Our framework provides a general and unified approach to understanding Sigma protocols.
It not only neatly explains the classic protocols such as Schnorr, Guillou–Quisquater and Okamoto protocols, but also leads to new Sigma protocols that were not previously known.

Furthermore, we show an application of our framework in designing ZKPs for composite statements, which contain both algebraic and non-algebraic statements. We give a generic construction of non-interactive ZKPs for composite statements by combining Sigma protocols from VSS and ZKPs following MPC-in-the-head paradigm in a seamless way via a technique of {\textbackslash}textit\{witness sharing reusing\}. Our construction has advantages of requiring no “glue” proofs for combining algebraic and non-algebraic statements. By instantiating our construction using Ligero++ (Bhadauria et al., CCS 2020) and designing an associated Sigma protocol from VSS, we obtain a concrete ZKP for composite statements which achieves a tradeoff between running time and proof size, thus resolving the open problem left by Backes et al. (PKC 2019).},

Using a software library that has been designed for other purposes (e.g., key-exchange or digital signatures) to compute commitments can be complicated or ineﬃcient. We present in this paper a ﬂexible implementation of Pedersen commitments based on elliptic curves in twisted Edwards form. The implementation supports a set of ﬁve curves of varying cryptographic strength, which are deﬁned over 127, 159, 191, 223, and 255-bit pseudo-Mersenne prime ﬁelds. One can dynamically (i.e., at runtime) choose one of the curves according to the required level of security, and it is also possible to adapt to the size of the data to be committed by varying the number of base points. The point arithmetic is performed with optimized formulas using extended coordinates and dynamically pre-computed tables are utilized to speed up the scalar multiplication. Our implementation is written in ANSI C (with optional x86 assembler optimizations for the ﬁeld arithmetic) and was compiled and tested successfully with Visual C on Windows, gcc on Linux, and clang on macOS. We present detailed benchmarking results for the ﬁeld and point arithmetic on all ﬁve curves. When using an Intel Core i7 processor clocked at 2.7 GHz as test platform, we can compute more than 38,000 commitments per second on a twisted Edwards curve over a 127-bit ﬁeld.},

Previous practical schemes also relied very heavily on the involvement of a trusted center. In the present paper we give a formal deﬁnition of pseudonym systems where users are motivated not to share their identity, and in which the trusted center’s involvement is minimal. We give theoretical constructions for such systems based on any one-way function. We also suggest an eﬃcient and easy-to-implement practical scheme.},

Recently, many systems claim to give control to individuals, promising the preeminent goal of data sovereignty. However, despite recent attention, research and industry efforts are fragmented and lack a holistic system overview. In this paper, we provide the first transecting systematization of data sovereignty by drawing from a dispersed body of knowledge. We clarify the field by identifying its three main areas: (i) decentralized identity, (ii) decentralized access control and (iii) policy-compliant decentralized computation. We find that literature lacks a cohesive set of formal definitions. Each area is considered in isolation, and priorities in industry and academia are not aligned due to a lack of clarity regarding user control. To solve this issue, we propose formal definitions for each sub-area. By highlighting that data sovereignty transcends the domain of decentralized identity, we aim to guide future works to embrace a broader perspective on user control. In each section, we augment our definition with security and privacy properties, discuss the state of the art and proceed to identify open challenges. We conclude by highlighting synergies between areas, emphasizing the real-world benefit obtained by further developing data sovereign systems.},

	abstract = {Despite the existence of multiple great resources on zk-SNARK construction, from original papers to explainers, due to the sheer number of moving parts the subject remains a black box for many. While some pieces of the puzzle are given one can not see the full picture without the missing ones. Hence the focus of this work is to shed light onto the topic with a straightforward and clean approach based on examples and answering many whys along the way so that more individuals can appreciate the state of the art technology, its innovators and ultimately the beauty of math. Paper's contribution is a simplistic exposition with a sufficient and gradually increasing level of complexity, necessary to understand zk-SNARK without any prerequisite knowledge of the subject, cryptography or advanced math. The primary goal is not only to explain how it works but why it works and how it came to be this way.},

The protocol has very low cost to the prover in the case where the size \$m\$ of the subset vector is much smaller than the size \$n\$ of the one containing it. The asymptotic prover complexity is \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2 + m {\textbackslash}log n)\$, where the \${\textbackslash}log n\$ dependence comes from a subprotocol showing that the roots of a blinded polynomial are all \$n\$th roots of unity. In this work, we show how to simplify this argument, replacing the subprotocol with a polynomial divisibility check and thereby reducing the asymptotic prover complexity to \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2)\$, removing any dependence on \$n\$.},

We present a universal SNARK construction with fully succinct verification, and significantly lower prover running time (roughly 7.5-20 less group exponentiations than [MBKM] in the fully succinct verifier mode depending on circuit structure).

Similarly to [MBKM], we rely on a permutation argument based on Bayer and Groth [Eurocrypt 2012]. However, we focus on ``Evaluations on a subgroup rather than coefficients of monomials''; which enables simplifying both the permutation argument and the artihmetization step.},

Non-malleable succinct proofs and very efficient verification make SE zk-SNARKs an elegant tool in various privacy-preserving applications such as cryptocurrencies, smart contracts and etc. In Eurocrypt 2016, Groth proposed the most efficient pairing-based zk-SNARK in the CRS model, but its proof is vulnerable to the malleability attacks. In this paper, we show that one can efficiently achieve simulation extractability in Groth's zk-SNARK by some changes in the underlying language using an OR construction. Analysis and implementations show that in practical cases overload has minimal effects on the efficiency of original scheme which currently is the most efficient zk-SNARK. In new construction, proof size is extended with one element from \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{G\}\_1\$, one element from \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{G\}\_2\$, plus a bit string that totally is less than 256 bytes for 128-bit security. Its verification is dominated with 4 pairings which is the most efficient verification among current SE zk-SNARKs.},

To instantiate our methodology we additionally prove that KZG commitments satisfy our simulation extractability requirement, despite being naturally malleable. To this end, we design a relaxed notion of simulation extractability that matches how KZG commitments are used and optimized in real-world prove systems.
Only the proof that KZG satisfies this relaxed simulation extractability property relies on the algebraic group model (AGM) and random oracle (RO). We thus isolate the use of (and thus the reliance on) these strong heuristics.},

Most of the works that investigate SE focus on its strong variant which implies proof non-malleability. In this work we investigate a relaxed weaker notion, that allows proof randomization, while guaranteeing statement non-malleability, which we argue to be a more natural security property. First, we show that it is already achievable by Groth16, arguably the most eﬃcient and widely deployed SNARK nowadays. Second, we show that because of this, Groth16 can be eﬃciently transformed into a blackbox weakly SE NIZK, which is suﬃcient for UC protocols.},

	abstract = {There have been tremendous advances in reducing interaction, communication and verification time in zero-knowledge proofs but it remains an important challenge to make the prover efficient. We construct the first zero-knowledge proof of knowledge for the correct execution of a program on public and private inputs where the prover computation is nearly linear time. This saves a polylogarithmic factor in asymptotic performance compared to current state of the art proof systems.

We use the TinyRAM model to capture general purpose processor computation. An instance consists of a TinyRAM program and public inputs. The witness consists of additional private inputs to the program. The prover can use our proof system to convince the verifier that the program terminates with the intended answer within given time and memory bounds. Our proof system has perfect completeness, statistical special honest verifier zero-knowledge, and computational knowledge soundness assuming linear-time computable collision-resistant hash functions exist.

The main advantage of our new proof system is asymptotically efficient prover computation. The prover's running time is only a superconstant factor larger than the program's running time in an apples-to-apples comparison where the prover uses the same TinyRAM model. Our proof system is also efficient on the other performance parameters; the verifier's running time time and the communication are sublinear in the execution time of the program and we only use a log-logarithmic number of rounds.},

	abstract = {In last years, there has been an increasing effort to leverage distributed ledger technology (DLT), including blockchain. One of the main topics of interest, given its importance, is the research and development of privacy mechanisms, as for example is the case of zero knowledge proofs (ZKP). ZKP is a cryptographic technique that can be used to hide information that is put into the ledger, while still allowing to perform validation of this data. In this work we describe different strategies to construct zero knowledge range proofs (ZKRP), as for example the scheme proposed by Boudot (in: Bart (ed) Advances in cryptology—EUROCRYPT 2000, Springer, Berlin, 2000) in 2001; the one proposed by Camenisch et al. (in: Josef (ed) Advances in cryptology—ASIACRYPT 2008, Springer, Berlin, 2008), and bulletproofs (Bünz et al., in: 2018 IEEE symposium on security and privacy (SP), 2018), proposed in 2017. We also compare these strategies and discuss possible use cases. Since bulletproofs (Bünz et al. 2018) is the most efficient construction, we will give a detailed description of its algorithms and optimizations. Bulletproofs is not only more efficient than previous schemes, but also avoids the trusted setup, which is a requirement that is not desirable in the context of DLT and blockchain. In case of cryptocurrencies, if the setup phase is compromised, it would be possible to generate money out of thin air. Interestingly, bulletproofs can also be used to construct generic ZKP, in the sense that it can be used to prove generic statements, and thus it is not only restricted to ZKRP, but it can be used for any kind of proof of knowledge. Hence Bulletproofs leads to a more powerful tool to provide privacy for DLT. Here we describe in detail the algorithms involved in Bulletproofs protocol for ZKRP. Also, we present our implementation, which was open sourced (Morais et al., in: Zero knowledge range proof implementation, 2018. https://github.com/ing-bank/zkrangeproof ).},

	abstract = {The area of practical computational integrity proof systems, like SNARKs, STARKs, Bulletproofs, is seeing a very dynamic development with several constructions having appeared recently with improved properties and relaxed setup requirements. Many use cases of such systems involve, often as their most expensive part, proving the knowledge of a preimage under a certain cryptographic hash function, which is expressed as a circuit over a large prime field. A notable example is a zero-knowledge proof of coin ownership in the Zcash cryptocurrency, where the inadequacy of the SHA-256 hash function for such a circuit caused a huge computational penalty.

In this paper, we present a modular framework and concrete instances of cryptographic hash functions which work natively with GF(p) objects. Our hash function Poseidon uses up to 8x fewer constraints per message bit than Pedersen Hash.

Our construction is not only expressed compactly as a circuit, but can also be tailored for various proof systems using specially crafted polynomials, thus bringing another boost in performance. We demonstrate this by implementing a 1-out-of-a-billion membership proof with Merkle trees in less than a second by using Bulletproofs.},

In addition, our scheme is hiding: a commitment and proofs for some values reveal no information about the remaining values.

We build Pointproofs and demonstrate how to apply them to blockchain smart contracts. In our example application, Pointproofs reduce bandwidth overheads for propagating a block of transactions by at least 60\% compared to prior state-of-art vector commitments.

Pointproofs are also efficient: on a single-thread, it takes 0.08 seconds to generate a proof for 8 values with respect to one commitment, 0.25 seconds to aggregate 4000 such proofs across multiple commitments into one proof, and 23 seconds (0.7 ms per value proven) to verify the aggregated proof.},

	abstract = {The lack of privacy in the first generation of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, etc. is a well known problem in cryptocurrency research. To overcome this problem, several new cryptocurrencies were designed to guarantee transaction privacy and anonymity for their users (examples include ZCash, Monero, etc.).

However, the anonymity provided by such systems appears to be fundamentally problematic in current business and legislation settings: banks and other financial institutions must follow rules such as "Know your customer" (KYC), "Anti Money Laundering" (AML), etc. It is also well known that the (alleged or real) anonymity guarantees provided by cryptocurrencies have attracted ill-intentioned individual to this space, who look at cryptocurrencies as a way of facilitating illegal activities (tax-evasion, ransom-ware, trading of illegal substances, etc.).

The fact that current cryptocurrencies do not comply with such regulations can in part explain why traditional financial institutions have so far been very sceptical of the ongoing cryptocurrency and Blockchain revolution.

In this paper, we propose a novel design principle for identity management in Blockchains. The goal of our design is to maintain privacy, while still allowing compliance with current regulations and preventing exploitations of Blockchain technology for purposes which are incompatible with the social good.},

	abstract = {We put forward the study of a new primitive that we call \{{\textbackslash}em Vector Commitment\} (VC, for short). Informally, VCs allow to commit to an ordered sequence of \$q\$ values \$(m\_1, {\textbackslash}ldots, m\_q)\$ in such a way that one can later open the commitment at specific positions (e.g., prove that \$m\_i\$ is the \$i\$-th committed message). For security, Vector Commitments are required to satisfy a notion that we call {\textbackslash}emph\{position binding\} which states that an adversary should not be able to open a commitment to two different values at the same position. Moreover, what makes our primitive interesting is that we require VCs to be \{{\textbackslash}em concise\}, i.e. the size of the commitment string and of its openings has to be independent of the vector length.

We show two realizations of VCs based on standard and well established assumptions, such as RSA, and Computational Diffie-Hellman (in bilinear groups). Next, we turn our attention to applications and we show that Vector Commitments are useful in a variety of contexts, as they allow for compact and efficient solutions which significantly improve previous works either in terms of efficiency of the resulting solutions, or in terms of "quality" of the underlying assumption, or both. These applications include: Verifiable Databases with Efficient Updates, Updatable Zero-Knowledge Databases, and Universal Dynamic Accumulators.},

	abstract = {As blockchains grow in size, validating new transactions becomes more and more resource intensive. To deal with this, there is a need to discover compact encodings of the (effective) state of a blockchain -- an encoding that allows for efficient proofs of membership and updates. In the case of account-based cryptocurrencies, the state can be represented by a key-value map, where keys are the account addresses and values consist of account balance, nonce, etc.

We propose a new commitment scheme for key-value maps whose size does not grow with the number of keys, yet proofs of membership are of constant-size. In fact, both the encoding and the proofs consist of just two and three group elements respectively (in groups of unknown order like class groups). Verifying and updating proofs involves just a few group exponentiations. Additive updates to key values enjoy the same level of efficiency too.

Key-value commitments can be used to build dynamic accumulators and vector commitments, which find applications in group signatures, anonymous credentials, verifiable databases, interactive oracle proofs, etc. Using our new key-value commitment, we provide the most efficient constructions of (sub)vector commitments to date.},

The application of the cryptographic accumulator is also more extensive. This paper makes a systematic summary of the cryptographic accumulator. Firstly, descriptions and characteristics of cryptographic accumulators are given, and the one-way accumulator, collision-free accumulator, dynamic accumulator, and universal accumulator are introduced, respectively. Cryptographic accumulator can be divided into two types: symmetric accumulator and asymmetric accumulator. In the asymmetric accumulator, three different cryptographic accumulator schemes were classified based on three security assumptions.

Most proposed systems, however, rely on a gossip protocol by which users can be assured that they have the same view of the log, but the few gossip protocols that do exist today are not suited for near-term deployment. Furthermore, they assume the presence of global sets of auditors, who must be blindly trusted to correctly perform their roles, in order to achieve their stated transparency goals. In this paper, we address both of these issues by proposing a gossip protocol and a verifiable registry, Mog, in which users can perform their own auditing themselves. We prove the security of our protocols and demonstrate via experimental evaluations that they are performant in a variety of potential near-term deployments.},

We also provide a constant sized batch non-membership proof for a large number of elements. These proofs can be used to build the first positional vector commitment (VC) with constant sized openings and constant sized public parameters. As a core building block for our batching techniques we develop several succinct proof systems in groups of unknown order. These extend a recent construction of a succinct proof of correct exponentiation, and include a succinct proof of knowledge of an integer discrete logarithm between two group elements.
We use these new constructions to design a stateless blockchain, where nodes only need a constant amount of storage in order to participate in consensus.
Further, we show how to use these techniques to reduce the size of IOP instantiations, such as STARKs.},

	abstract = {Today, digital identity management for individuals is either inconvenient and error-prone or creates undesirable lock-in effects and violates privacy and security expectations. These shortcomings inhibit the digital transformation in general and seem particularly concerning in the context of novel applications such as access control for decentralized autonomous organizations and identification in the Metaverse. Decentralized or self-sovereign identity (SSI) aims to offer a solution to this dilemma by empowering individuals to manage their digital identity through machine-verifiable attestations stored in a "digital wallet" application on their edge devices. However, when presented to a relying party, these attestations typically reveal more attributes than required and allow tracking end users' activities. Several academic works and practical solutions exist to reduce or avoid such excessive information disclosure, from simple selective disclosure to data-minimizing anonymous credentials based on zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs). We first demonstrate that the SSI solutions that are currently built with anonymous credentials still lack essential features such as scalable revocation, certificate chaining, and integration with secure elements. We then argue that general-purpose ZKPs in the form of zk-SNARKs can appropriately address these pressing challenges. We describe our implementation and conduct performance tests on different edge devices to illustrate that the performance of zk-SNARK-based anonymous credentials is already practical. We also discuss further advantages that general-purpose ZKPs can easily provide for digital wallets, for instance, to create "designated verifier presentations" that facilitate new design options for digital identity infrastructures that previously were not accessible because of the threat of man-in-the-middle attacks.},

	abstract = {Anonymous communications networks, such as Tor, help to solve the real and important problem of enabling users to communicate privately over the Internet. However, in doing so, anonymous communications networks introduce an entirely new problem for the service providers—such as websites, IRC networks or mail servers—with which these users interact; in particular, since all anonymous users look alike, there is no way for the service providers to hold individual misbehaving anonymous users accountable for their actions. Recent research efforts have focused on using anonymous blacklisting systems (which are sometimes called anonymous revocation systems) to empower service providers with the ability to revoke access from abusive anonymous users. In contrast to revocable anonymity systems, which enable some trusted third party to deanonymize users, anonymous blacklisting systems provide users with a way to authenticate anonymously with a service provider, while enabling the service provider to revoke access from any users that misbehave, without revealing their identities. In this paper, we introduce the anonymous blacklisting problem and survey the literature on anonymous blacklisting systems, comparing and contrasting the architecture of various existing schemes, and discussing the tradeoffs inherent with each design. The literature on anonymous blacklisting systems lacks a uniﬁed set of deﬁnitions; each scheme operates under different trust assumptions and provides different security and privacy guarantees. Therefore, before we discuss the existing approaches in detail, we ﬁrst propose a formal deﬁnition for anonymous blacklisting systems, and a set of security and privacy properties that these systems should possess. We also outline a set of new performance requirements that anonymous blacklisting systems should satisfy to maximize their potential for real-world adoption, and give formal deﬁnitions for several optional features already supported by some schemes in the literature.},

Subsequently we discuss identifiers in such a system, presenting past research in the area and current approaches in SSI in the context of Zooko's Triangle. As the user of an SSI has to be linked with his digital identifier we also discuss authentication solutions. Most central to the concept of an SSI are the verifiable claims that are presented to relying parties. Resources in the field are only losely connected. We will provide a more coherent view of verifiable claims in regards to blockchain based SSI and clarify differences in the used terminology.

It has optimal communication complexity and, when combined with efficient zero-knowledge proofs, provides an ideal solution for anonymous revocation. For the construction of Braavos we use a modular approach: we show how to build an accumulator with better functionality and security from accumulators with fewer features and weaker security guarantees. We then describe an anonymous revocation component (ARC) that can be instantiated using any dynamic accumulator. ARC can be added to any anonymous system, such as anonymous credentials or group signatures, in order to equip it with a revocation functionality. Finally, we implement ARC with Braavos and plug it into Idemix, the leading implementation of anonymous credentials.

	url = {https://eprint.iacr.org/2023/743},
	abstract = {Anonymous systems (e.g. anonymous cryptocurrencies and updatable anonymous credentials) often follow a construction template where an account can only perform a single anonymous action, which in turn potentially spawns new (and still single-use) accounts (e.g. UTXO with a balance to spend or session with a score to claim). Due to the anonymous nature of the action, no party can be sure which account has taken part in an action and, therefore, must maintain an ever-growing list of potentially unused accounts to ensure that the system keeps running correctly. Consequently, anonymous systems constructed based on this common template are seemingly not sustainable.

In this work, we study the sustainability of ring-based anonymous systems, where a user performing an anonymous action is hidden within a set of decoy users, traditionally called a ``ring''.

On the positive side, we propose a general technique for ring-based anonymous systems to achieve sustainability. Along the way, we define a general model of decentralised anonymous systems (DAS) for arbitrary anonymous actions, and provide a generic construction which provably achieves sustainability. As a special case, we obtain the first construction of anonymous cryptocurrencies achieving sustainability without compromising availability. We also demonstrate the generality of our model by constructing sustainable decentralised anonymous social networks.

On the negative side, we show empirically that Monero, one of the most popular anonymous cryptocurrencies, is unlikely to be sustainable without altering its current ring sampling strategy. The main subroutine is a sub-quadratic-time algorithm for detecting used accounts in a ring-based anonymous system.},

Sessions can be judged in any order and at varying times without affecting all users. Any backlog of unjudged sessions only affects the users behind them.

In this work, we give new client-auditable verifiable registries with throughputs up to \$100{\textbackslash}times\$ greater than baseline IVC solutions. Our approach relies on an authenticated dictionary based on RSA accumulators for which we develop a new constant-size invariant proof. We use this as a replacement for Merkle trees to optimize the baseline IVC approach, but also provide a novel construction which dispenses with SNARKs entirely.

	abstract = {Blacklistable anonymous credential systems provide service providers with a way to authenticate users according to their historical behaviors, while guaranteeing that all users can access services in an anonymous and unlinkable manner, thus are potentially useful in practice. Traditionally, to protect services from illegal access, the credential issuer, which completes the registration with users, must be trusted by the service provider. However, in practice, this trust assumption is usually unsatisfied. Besides, to better evaluate users, it is desired to use blacklists, which record historical behaviors of users, of other service providers, but currently, this will threaten the security unless a strong trust assumption is made. Another potential security issue in current blacklistable anonymous credential systems is the blacklist gaming attack, where the service provider attempt to compromise the privacy of users via generating blacklist maliciously.

In this paper, we solve these problems and present the decentralized blacklistable anonymous credential system with reputation, which inherits nearly all features of the BLACR system presented in Au et.al. (NDSS'12). However, in our new system, no trusted party is needed to register users. Moreover, blacklists from other service providers can be used safely in the new system assuming a minimal trust assumption holds. Besides, the new system is also partially resilient to the blacklist gaming attack. Technically, the main approach to solving these problems is a novel use of the blockchain technique, which serve as a public append-only ledger and are used to store credentials and blacklists. To simplify the construction, we also present a generic framework for constructing our new system. The general framework can be instantiated from three different types of cryptographic systems, including the RSA system, the classical DL system, and the pairing based system, and all these three types of instantiations can be supported simultaneously in the framework. To demonstrate the practicability of our system, we also give a proof of concept implementation for the instantiation under the RSA system. The experiment results indicate that when authenticating with blacklists of reasonable size, our implementation can fulfill practical efficiency demands, and when authenticating with empty blacklists, it is more efficient than that of Garman et al. (NDSS'14), which presents a decentralized anonymous credential system without considering revocation.},

Previous updatable anonymous credentials keep a chronological queue of authenticated sessions and a global pointer to the last chunk of judged sessions. This design allows efﬁcient authentication for proving over only a subset of sessions. However, complications in subjective evaluation often introduce hard-to-judge sessions, which halt all users since sessions that come after the global pointer cannot be redeemed, eventually exceeding the queue size that limits the creation of bad sessions. Such a global-halting loophole may also make judgments overly harsh and hasty. We propose SMART (slack management of anonymous reputation traits), maintaining multiple queues so the server could issue interim judgments many times before ﬁnalization. Such slackness removes the binary judgment of old methods and mitigates the global-halting issue.

	abstract = {Anonymous authentication can give users the license to misbehave since there is no fear of retribution. As a deterrent, or means to revocation, various schemes for accountable anonymity feature some kind of (possibly distributed) trusted third party (TTP) with the power to identify or link misbehaving users. Recently, schemes such as BLAC and PEREA showed how anonymous revocation can be achieved without such TTPs—anonymous users can be revoked if they misbehave, and yet nobody can identify or link such users cryptographically. Despite being the state of the art in anonymous revocation, these schemes allow only a basic form of revocation amounting to ‘revoke anybody with d or more misbehaviors’ or ‘revoke anybody whose combined misbehavior score is too high’ (where misbehaviors are assigned a ‘severity’ score). We present BLACR, which significantly advances anonymous revocation in three ways: 1) It constitutes a first attempt to generalize reputation-based anonymous revocation, where negative or positive scores can be assigned to anonymous sessions across multiple categories. Servers can block users based on policies, which specify a boolean combination of reputations in these categories; 2) We present a weighted extension, which allows the total severity score to ramp up for multiple misbehaviors by the same user; and, 3) We make a significant improvement in authentication times through a technique we call express lane authentication, which makes reputation-based anonymous revocation practical.},

	abstract = {Several credential systems have been proposed in which users can authenticate to service providers anonymously. Since anonymity can give users the license to misbehave, some variants allow the selective deanonymization (or linking) of misbehaving users upon a complaint to a Trusted Third Party (TTP). The ability of the TTP to revoke a user’s privacy at any time, however, is too strong a punishment for misbehavior. To limit the scope of deanonymization, some systems have been proposed in which users can be deanonymized only if they authenticate “too many times,” such as “double spending” with electronic cash. While useful in some applications, such techniques cannot be generalized to more subjective definitions of misbehavior, for example, using such schemes it is not possible to block anonymous users who “deface too many Web pages” on a Web site.
            
              We present BLAC, the first anonymous credential system in which service providers can revoke the credentials of misbehaving users without relying on a TTP . Since revoked users remain anonymous, misbehaviors can be judged subjectively without users fearing arbitrary deanonymization by a TTP . Additionally, our construction supports a
              d-strikes-out

	abstract = {This paper introduces Lasso, a new family of lookup arguments, which allow an untrusted prover to commit to a vector a∈Fm and prove that all entries of a reside in some predetermined table t∈Fn. Lasso’s performance characteristics unlock the so-called "lookup singularity". Lasso works with any multilinear polynomial commitment scheme, and provides the following efficiency properties.

For m lookups into a table of size n, Lasso’s prover commits to just m+n field elements. Moreover, the committed field elements are small, meaning that, no matter how big the field F is, they are all in the set \{0,...,m\}. When using a multiexponentiation-based commitment scheme, this results in the prover’s costs dominated by only O(m+n) group operations (e.g., elliptic curve point additions), plus the cost to prove an evaluation of a multilinear polynomial whose evaluations over the Boolean hypercube are the table entries. This represents a significant improvement in prover costs over prior lookup arguments (e.g., plookup, Halo2’s lookups, lookup arguments based on logarithmic derivatives).

Unlike all prior lookup arguments, if the table t is structured (in a precise sense that we define), then no party needs to commit to t, enabling the use of much larger tables than prior works (e.g., of size 2128 or larger). Moreover, Lasso’s prover only "pays" in runtime for table entries that are accessed by the lookup operations. This applies to tables commonly used to implement range checks, bitwise operations, big-number arithmetic, and even transitions of a full-fledged CPU such as RISC-V. Specifically, for any integer parameter c{\textgreater}1, Lasso’s prover’s dominant cost is committing to 3⋅c⋅m+c⋅n1/c field elements. Furthermore, all these field elements are “small”, meaning they are in the set \{0,...,max(m,n1/c,q)−1\}, where q is the maximum value in a.

Lasso’s starting point is Spark, a time-optimal polynomial commitment scheme for sparse polynomials in Spartan (CRYPTO 2020). We first provide a stronger security analysis for Spark. Spartan’s security analysis assumed that certain metadata associated with a sparse polynomial is committed by an honest party (this is acceptable for its purpose in Spartan, but not for Lasso). We prove that Spark remains secure even when that metadata is committed by a malicious party. This provides the first "standard" commitment scheme for sparse multilinear polynomials with optimal prover costs. We then generalize Spark to directly support a lookup argument for both structured and unstructured tables, with the efficiency characteristics noted above.},

	abstract = {An argument system for NP is a proof system that allows efficient verification of NP statements, given proofs produced by an untrusted yet computationally-bounded prover. Such a system is non-interactive and publicly-verifiable if, after a trusted party publishes a proving key and a verification key, anyone can use the proving key to generate non-interactive proofs for adaptively-chosen NP statements, and proofs can be verified by anyone by using the verification key.

We present an implementation of a publicly-verifiable non-interactive argument system for NP. The system, moreover, is a zero-knowledge proof-of-knowledge. It directly proves correct executions of programs on TinyRAM, a random-access machine tailored for efficient verification of nondeterministic computations. Given a program \$P\$ and time bound T, the system allows for proving correct execution of \$P\$, on any input \$x\$, for up to T steps, after a one-time setup requiring \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}({\textbar}P{\textbar} T)\$ cryptographic operations. An honest prover requires \${\textbackslash}tilde\{O\}({\textbar}P{\textbar} {\textbackslash}cdot T)\$ cryptographic operations to generate such a proof, while proof verification can be performed with only \$O({\textbar}x{\textbar})\$ cryptographic operations. This system can be used to prove the correct execution of C programs, using our TinyRAM port of the GCC compiler.

This yields a zero-knowledge Succinct Non-interactive ARgument of Knowledge (zk-SNARK) for program executions in the preprocessing model -- a powerful solution for delegating NP computations, with several features not achieved by previously-implemented primitives.

Our approach builds on recent theoretical progress in the area. We present efficiency improvements and implementations of two main ingredients:

* Given a C program, we produce a circuit whose satisfiability encodes the correctness of execution of the program. Leveraging nondeterminism, the generated circuit's size is merely quasilinear in the size of the computation. In particular, we efficiently handle arbitrary and data-dependent loops, control flow, and memory accesses. This is in contrast with existing ``circuit generators'', which in the general case produce circuits of quadratic size.

* Given a linear PCP for verifying satisfiability of circuits, we produce a corresponding SNARK. We construct such a linear PCP (which, moreover, is zero-knowledge and very efficient) by building on and improving on recent work on quadratic arithmetic programs.},

	abstract = {We present Hyperproofs, the first vector commitment (VC) scheme that is efficiently maintainable and aggregatable.
Similar to Merkle proofs, our proofs form a tree that can be efficiently maintained: updating all \$n\$ proofs in the tree after a single leaf change only requires \$O({\textbackslash}log\{n\})\$ time.
Importantly, unlike Merkle proofs, Hyperproofs are efficiently aggregatable, anywhere from \$10{\textbackslash}times\$ to \$41{\textbackslash}times\$ faster than SNARK-based aggregation of Merkle proofs.
At the same time, an individual Hyperproof consists of only \${\textbackslash}log\{n\}\$ algebraic hashes (e.g., 32-byte elliptic curve points) and an aggregation of \$b\$ such proofs is only \$O({\textbackslash}log\{(b{\textbackslash}log\{n\})\})\$-sized.
Hyperproofs are also reasonably fast to update when compared to Merkle trees with SNARK-friendly hash functions.

As another benefit over Merkle trees, Hyperproofs are homomorphic: digests (and proofs) for two vectors can be homomorphically combined into a digest (and proofs) for their sum.
Homomorphism is very useful in emerging applications such as stateless cryptocurrencies.
First, it enables unstealability, a novel property that incentivizes proof computation.
Second, it makes digests and proofs much more convenient to update.

Finally, Hyperproofs have certain limitations: they are not transparent, have linear-sized public parameters, are slower to verify, and have larger aggregated proofs and slower verification than SNARK-based approaches.
Nonetheless, end-to-end, aggregation and verification in Hyperproofs is \$10{\textbackslash}times\$ to \$41{\textbackslash}times\$ faster than in SNARK-based Merkle trees.},

One common use case of this primitive in the zk-SNARK setting is a ``batched range proof'', where one wishes to check all of \$f\$'s values on \$H\$ are in a range \$[0,{\textbackslash}ldots,M]\$.

	abstract = {We propose Bulletproofs, a new non-interactive zero-knowledge proof protocol
with very short proofs and without a trusted setup; the proof size is only logarithmic in the witness size.
Bulletproofs are especially well suited for efficient range proofs on committed values: they enable proving that a committed value is in a range using only \$2{\textbackslash}log\_2(n)+9\$ group and field elements, where \$n\$ is the bit length of the range.
Proof generation and verification times are linear in \$n\$.

Bulletproofs greatly improve on the linear (in \$n\$) sized range proofs in existing proposals for confidential transactions in Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.
Moreover, Bulletproofs supports aggregation of range proofs, so that a party can prove that \$m\$ commitments lie in a given range by providing only an additive \$O({\textbackslash}log(m))\$ group elements over the length of a single proof.
To aggregate proofs from multiple parties, we enable the parties to generate a single proof without revealing their inputs to each other via a simple multi-party computation (MPC) protocol for constructing Bulletproofs.
This MPC protocol uses either a constant number of rounds and linear communication, or a logarithmic number of rounds and logarithmic communication.
We show that verification time, while asymptotically linear, is very efficient in practice. Moreover, the verification of multiple Bulletproofs can be batched for further speed-up. Concretely, the marginal time to verify an aggregation of 16 range proofs is about the same as the time to verify 16 ECDSA signatures.

Bulletproofs build on the techniques of Bootle et al. (EUROCRYPT 2016).
Beyond range proofs, Bulletproofs provide short zero-knowledge proofs for general arithmetic circuits while only relying on the discrete logarithm assumption and without requiring a trusted setup.
We discuss many applications that would benefit from Bulletproofs, primarily in the area of cryptocurrencies.
The efficiency of Bulletproofs is particularly well suited for the distributed and trustless nature of blockchains.},

	abstract = {Restricting access to certified users is not only desirable for many blockchain applications, it is also legally mandated for decentralized finance (DeFi) applications to counter malicious actors. Existing solutions, however, are either (i) non-private, i.e., they reveal the link between users and their wallets to the authority granting credentials, or (ii) they introduce additional trust assumptions by relying on a decentralized oracle to verify anonymous credentials (ACs). To remove additional trust in the latter approach, we propose verifying credentials on-chain in this work. We find that this approach has impractical costs with prior AC schemes, and propose a new AC scheme ZEBRA that crucially relies on zkSNARKs to provide efficient on-chain verification for the first time. In addition to the standard unlinkability property that provides privacy for users, ZEBRA also supports auditability, revocation, traceability, and theft detection, which adds accountability for malicious users and convenience for honest users to our access control solution. Even with these properties, ZEBRA reduces the gas cost incurred on the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) by 14.3x when compared to Coconut [NDSS 2019], the state-of-the-art AC scheme for blockchains that only provides unlinkability. This improvement translates to a reduction in transaction fees from 176 USD to 12 USD on Ethereum in May 2023. Since 12 USD is still high for most applications, ZEBRA further drives down credential verification costs through batched verification. For a batch of 512 layer-1 and layer-2 wallets, the transaction fee on Ethereum is reduced to just 0.44 USD and 0.02 USD, respectively, which is comparable to the minimum transaction costs on Ethereum.},

In this work we propose a novel anonymous credential scheme that eliminates the need for a trusted credential issuer.

	abstract = {In the past decade, blockchains have seen various financial and technological innovations, with cryptocurrencies reaching a market cap of over 1 trillion dollars. However, scalability is one of the key issues hindering the deployment of blockchains in many applications. To improve the throughput of the transactions, zkRollups and zkEVM techniques using the cryptographic primitive of zero-knowledge proofs (ZKPs) have been proposed and many companies are adopting these technologies in the layer-2 solutions. However, in these technologies, the proof generation of the ZKP is the bottleneck and the companies have to deploy powerful machines with TBs of memory to batch a large number of transactions in a ZKP. 

In this work, we improve the scalability of these techniques by proposing new schemes of fully distributed ZKPs. Our schemes can improve the efficiency and the scalability of ZKPs using multiple machines, while the communication among the machines is minimal. With our schemes, the ZKP generation can be distributed to multiple participants in a model similar to the mining pools. Our protocols are based on Plonk, an efficient zero-knowledge proof system with a universal trusted setup. The first protocol is for data-parallel circuits.
For a computation of \$M\$ sub-circuits of size \$T\$ each, using \$M\$ machines, the prover time is \$O(T{\textbackslash}log T + M {\textbackslash}log M)\$, while the prover time of the original Plonk on a single machine is \$O(MT{\textbackslash}log (MT))\$. Our protocol incurs only \$O(1)\$ communication per machine, and the proof size and verifier time are both \$O(1)\$, the same as the original Plonk. Moreover, we show that with minor modifications, our second protocol can support general circuits with arbitrary connections while preserving the same proving, verifying, and communication complexity. The technique is general and may be of independent interest for other applications of ZKP. 

We implement Pianist (Plonk vIA uNlimited dISTribution), a fully distributed ZKP system using our protocols. Pianist can generate the proof for 8192 transactions in 313 seconds on 64 machines. This improves the scalability of the Plonk scheme by 64\${\textbackslash}times\$. The communication per machine is only 2.1 KB, regardless of the number of machines and the size of the circuit. The proof size is 2.2 KB and the verifier time is 3.5 ms. We further show that Pianist has similar improvements for general circuits. On a randomly generated circuit with \$2{\textasciicircum}\{25\}\$ gates, it only takes 5s to generate the proof using 32 machines, 24.2\${\textbackslash}times\$ faster than Plonk on a single machine.},

We use our methodology to obtain a preprocessing zkSNARK where the SRS has linear size and arguments have constant size. Our construction improves on Sonic [Maller et al., CCS 2019], the prior state of the art in this setting, in all efficiency parameters: proving is an order of magnitude faster and verification is thrice as fast, even with smaller SRS size and argument size. Our construction is most efficient when instantiated in the algebraic group model (also used by Sonic), but we also demonstrate how to realize it under concrete knowledge assumptions. We implement and evaluate our construction.

The core of our preprocessing zkSNARK is an efficient *algebraic holographic proof* (AHP) for rank-1 constraint satisfiability (R1CS) that achieves linear proof length and constant query complexity.},

The performances known in the literature for range proofs are logarithmic-sized proofs and linear veriﬁcation time. In contexts where the proof veriﬁcation is left to the ledger maintainers and proofs are stored in blocks, one might expect higher transaction fees and blockchain space when the size of the relation over the proof grows. With this paper, we improve Bulletproofs, a zero-knowledge argument of knowledge for range proofs, by modifying its Inner Product Argument (IPA) subroutine. In particular, we adopt a new relation from the polynomial commitment scheme of Halo, based on standard groups and assumptions (DLOG and RO) with a trustless setup. We design a two-step reduction algorithm and we obtain a constant number of two rounds in the IPA and a constant-sized proof composed of 5 G1 points and 2 Zp scalars.},

Clients may later withdraw from the pool without linkage to previous deposits. Some privacy pools also support hidden transfer of currency ownership within the pool. In August 2022, the U.S. Department of Treasury sanctioned Tornado Cash, the largest Ethereum privacy pool, on the premise that it enables illicit actors to hide the origin of funds, citing its usage by the DPRK-sponsored Lazarus Group to launder over {\textbackslash}\$455 million dollars worth of stolen cryptocurrency. This ruling effectively made it illegal for U.S. persons/institutions to use or accept funds that went through Tornado Cash, sparking a global debate among privacy rights activists and lawmakers. Against this backdrop, we present Derecho, a system that institutions could use to request cryptographic attestations of fund origins rather than naively rejecting all funds coming from privacy pools. Derecho is a novel application of proof-carrying data, which allows users to propagate allowlist membership proofs through a privacy pool's transaction graph. Derecho is backwards-compatible with existing Ethereum privacy pool designs, adds no overhead in gas costs, and costs users only a few seconds to produce attestations.},

	abstract = {A common misconception among blockchain users is that pseudonymity guarantees privacy. The reality is almost the opposite. Every transaction one makes is recorded on a public ledger and reveals information about one's identity. Mixers, such as Tornado Cash, were developed to preserve privacy through "mixing" transactions with those of others in an anonymity pool, making it harder to link deposits and withdrawals from the pool. Unfortunately, it is still possible to reveal information about those in the anonymity pool if users are not careful. We introduce Tutela, an application built on expert heuristics to report the true anonymity of an Ethereum address. In particular, Tutela has three functionalities: first, it clusters together Ethereum addresses based on interaction history such that for an Ethereum address, we can identify other addresses likely owned by the same entity; second, it shows Ethereum users their potentially compromised transactions; third, Tutela computes the true size of the anonymity pool of each Tornado Cash mixer by excluding potentially compromised transactions. A public implementation of Tutela can be found at https://github.com/TutelaLabs/tutela-app. To use Tutela, visit https://www.tutela.xyz.},

Such a system is anonymous when transactions carried out by the same user cannot be linked. An anonymous credential system is of signiﬁcant practical relevance because it is the best means of providing privacy for users. In this paper we propose a practical anonymous credential system that is based on the strong RSA assumption and the decisional Diﬃe-Hellman assumption modulo a safe prime product and is considerably superior to existing ones: (1) We give the ﬁrst practical solution that allows a user to unlinkably demonstrate possession of a credential as many times as necessary without involving the issuing organization. (2) To prevent misuse of anonymity, our scheme is the ﬁrst to oﬀer optional anonymity revocation for particular transactions. (3) Our scheme oﬀers separability: all organizations can choose their cryptographic keys independently of each other. Moreover, we suggest more eﬀective means of preventing users from sharing their credentials, by introducing allor-nothing sharing: a user who allows a friend to use one of her credentials once, gives him the ability to use all of her credentials, i.e., taking over her identity. This is implemented by a new primitive, called circular encryption, which is of independent interest, and can be realized from any semantically secure cryptosystem in the random oracle model.},

In particular, users are now wanting to reduce the amount of personal information they share in order to gain access to services. Since their introduction by Chaum (Comm. ACM 1985) there have been a plethora of results attempting to instantiate them with the ﬁrst fully anonymous scheme being realised by Camenish and Lysyanskaya (EUROCRYPT 2001). Since this breakthrough result, there have been several newer schemes that have been proposed that not only improve on the Camenish-Lysyanskaya scheme but also introduce new features. In fact there have been a large variety of extensions proposed that have led to a seemingly incomparable landscape of schemes. In this paper, we review the many properties of anonymous credential systems, and systematically categorise and compare the approaches in the literature.

For both single- and multi-membership proofs Caulk beats SNARKed Merkle proofs by the factor of 100 even if the latter instantiated with Poseidon hash. Asymptotically our prover needs \$O(m{\textasciicircum}2 + m{\textbackslash}log N)\$ time to prove a batch of \$m\$ openings, whereas proof size is \$O(1)\$ and verifier time is \$O({\textbackslash}log({\textbackslash}log N))\$.

As a lookup argument, Caulk is the first scheme with prover time sublinear in the table size, assuming \$O(N{\textbackslash}log N)\$ preprocessing time and \$O(N)\$ storage. It can be used as a subprimitive in verifiable computation schemes in order to drastically decrease the lookup overhead.

	abstract = {In this work we improve upon the state of the art for practical zero-knowledge for set membership, a building block at the core of several privacy-aware applications, such as anonymous payments, credentials and whitelists. This primitive allows a user to show knowledge of an element in a large set without leaking the specific element. One of the obstacles to its deployment is efficiency. Concretely efficient solutions exist, e.g., those deployed in Zcash Sapling, but they often work at the price of a strong trust assumption: an underlying setup that must be generated by a trusted third party.

To find alternative approaches we focus on a common building block: accumulators, a cryptographic data structure which compresses the underlying set. We propose novel, more efficient and fully transparent constructions (i.e., without a trusted setup) for accumulators supporting zero-knowledge proofs for set membership. Technically, we introduce new approaches inspired by ``commit-and-prove'' techniques to combine shallow Merkle trees and 2-cycles of elliptic curves into a highly practical construction. Our basic accumulator construction---dubbed Curve Trees---is completely transparent (does not require a trusted setup) and is based on simple and widely used assumptions (DLOG and Random Oracle Model). Ours is the first fully transparent construction that obtains concretely small proof/commitment sizes for large sets and a proving time one order of magnitude smaller than proofs over Merkle Trees with Pedersen hash. For a concrete instantiation targeting 128 bits of security we obtain: a commitment to a set of any size is 256 bits; for \${\textbar}S{\textbar} = 2{\textasciicircum}\{40\}\$ a zero-knowledge membership proof is 2.9KB, its proving takes \$2\$s and its verification \$40\$ms on an ordinary laptop.

Using our construction as a building block we can design a simple and concretely efficient anonymous cryptocurrency with full anonymity set, which we dub \${\textbackslash}mathbb\{V\}\$cash. Its transactions can be verified in \${\textbackslash}approx 80\$ms or \${\textbackslash}approx 5\$ms when batch-verifying multiple (\${\textgreater} 100\$) transactions; transaction sizes are \$4\$KB. Our timings are competitive with those of the approach in Zcash Sapling and trade slightly larger proofs (transactions in Zcash Sapling are 2.8KB) for a completely transparent setup.},

Specifically, an efficient selective revocation mechanism is proposed based on dynamic accumulators and the signature algorithm due to Pointcheval and Sanders as the overlay of the BASS. According to the diverse demands of credential authorities, BASS can selectively provide revocation of credentials or revocation of users. We extend BASS from single-attribute privacy to multiattribute privacy as well. Finally, we implement a prototype to evaluate the cryptographic core primitives of BASS by deploying smart contracts in Ethereum to demonstrate the validity of BASS in smart industrial applications.},

Furthermore, they assume the presence of global sets of auditors, who must be blindly trusted to correctly perform their roles, in order to achieve their stated transparency goals. In this paper, we address both of these issues by proposing a gossip protocol and a veriﬁable registry, Mog, in which users can perform their own auditing themselves.

However, in their native form, zk-SNARKs only apply to a secret witness held by a single party. In practice, a collection of parties often need to prove a statement where the secret witness is distributed or shared among them. We implement and experiment with collaborative zkSNARKs: proofs over the secrets of multiple, mutually distrusting parties. We construct these by lifting conventional zk-SNARKs into secure protocols among N provers to jointly produce a single proof over the distributed witness. We optimize the proof generation algorithm in pairing-based zkSNARKs so that algebraic techniques for multiparty computation (MPC) yield efficient proof generation protocols. For some zk-SNARKs, optimization is more challenging. This suggests MPC “friendliness” as an additional criterion for evaluating zk-SNARKs.},

	abstract = {Traditional zero-knowledge protocols have been studied and optimized for the setting where a single prover holds the complete witness and tries to convince a verifier about a predicate on the witness, without revealing any additional information to the verifier. In this work, we study the notion of distributed-prover zero knowledge (DPZK) for arbitrary predicates where the witness is shared among multiple mutually distrusting provers and they want to convince a verifier that their shares together satisfy the predicate. We make the following contributions to the notion of distributed proof generation: (i) we propose a new MPC-style security definition to capture the adversarial settings possible for different collusion models between the provers and the verifier, (ii) we discuss new efficiency parameters for distributed proof generation such as the number of rounds of interaction and the amount of communication among the provers, and (iii) we propose a compiler that realizes distributed proof generation from the zero-knowledge protocols in the Interactive Oracle Proofs (IOP) paradigm. Our compiler can be used to obtain DPZK from arbitrary IOP protocols, but the concrete efficiency overheads are substantial in general. To this end, we contribute (iv) a new zero-knowledge IOP \${\textbackslash}textsf\{Graphene\}\$ which can be compiled into an efficient DPZK protocol. The \$({\textbackslash}mathsf\{D\} + 1)\$-DPZK protocol \${\textbackslash}text\{D-Graphene\}\$, with \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{D\}\$ provers and one verifier, admits \$O(N{\textasciicircum}\{1/c\})\$ proof size with a communication complexity of \$O({\textbackslash}mathsf\{D\}{\textasciicircum}2{\textbackslash}cdot (N{\textasciicircum}\{1-2/c\} + N\_s))\$, where \$N\$ is the number of gates in the arithmetic circuit representing the predicate and \$N\_s\$ is the number of wires that depends on inputs from two or more parties. Significantly, only the distributed proof generation in \${\textbackslash}text\{D-Graphene\}\$ requires interaction among the provers. \${\textbackslash}text\{D-Graphene\}\$ compares favourably with the DPZK protocols obtained from the state-of-art zero-knowledge protocols, even those not modelled as IOPs.},

We also provide an instantiation of function-dependent commitments for linear functions that is unconditionally, i.e. information-theoretically, hiding and relies on standard hardness assumptions. This powerful construction can for instance be used to build verifiable computing schemes providing information-theoretic confidentiality. As an example, we introduce a verifiable multi-party computation scheme for shared data providing public verifiability and unconditional privacy towards the servers and parties verifying the correctness of the result. Our scheme can be used to perform verifiable computations on secret shares while requiring only a single party to compute the audit data for verification. Furthermore, our verification procedure is asymptotically even more efficient than performing operations locally on the shared data. Thus, our solution improves the state of the art for authenticated computing, verifiable computing and multi-party computation.},

To solve this problem, we propose Trinocchio: a system that distributes Pinocchio to three (or more) workers, that each individually do not learn which inputs they are computing on. We fully exploit the almost linear structure of Pinochhio proofs, letting each worker essentially perform the work for a single Pinocchio proof; veriﬁcation by the client remains the same. Moreover, we extend Trinocchio to enable joint computation with multiple mutually distrusting inputters and outputters and still very fast veriﬁcation. We show the feasibility of our approach by analysing the performance of an implementation in a case study.},

We present Hyperproofs, the first vector commitment (VC) scheme that is efficiently maintainable and aggregatable. Similar to Merkle proofs, our proofs form a tree that can be efficiently maintained: updating all n proofs in the tree after a single leaf change only requires O(logn) time. Importantly, unlike Merkle proofs, Hyperproofs are efficiently aggregatable, anywhere from 10× to 41× faster than SNARK-based aggregation of Merkle proofs. At the same time, an individual Hyperproof consists of only logn algebraic hashes (e.g., 32-byte elliptic curve points) and an aggregation of b such proofs is only O(log(blogn))-sized. Hyperproofs are also reasonably fast to update when compared to Merkle trees with SNARK-friendly hash functions.As another benefit over Merkle trees, Hyperproofs are homomorphic: digests (and proofs) for two vectors can be homomorphically combined into a digest (and proofs) for their sum. Homomorphism is very useful in emerging applications such as stateless cryptocurrencies. First, it enables unstealability, a novel property that incentivizes proof computation. Second, it makes digests and proofs much more convenient to update.Finally, Hyperproofs have certain limitations: they are not transparent, have linear-sized public parameters, are slower to verify, and have larger aggregated proofs and slower verification than SNARK-based approaches. Nonetheless, end-to-end, aggregation and verification in Hyperproofs is 10× to 41× faster than in SNARK-based Merkle trees.

However, it is computationally infeasible to find a witness for any non-accumulated value. Since their introduction, various accumulator schemes for numerous practical applications and with different features have been proposed. Unfortunately, to date there is no unifying model capturing all existing features. Such a model can turn out to be valuable as it allows to use accumulators in a black-box fashion. To this end, we propose a unified formal model for (randomized) cryptographic accumulators which covers static and dynamic accumulators, their universal features and includes the notions of undeniability and indistinguishability. Additionally, we provide an exhaustive classification of all existing schemes. In doing so, it turns out that most accumulators are distinguishable. Fortunately, a simple, light-weight generic transformation allows to make many existing dynamic accumulator schemes indistinguishable. As this transformation, however, comes at the cost of reduced collision freeness, we additionally propose the first indistinguishable scheme that does not suffer from this shortcoming. Finally, we employ our unified model for presenting a black-box construction of commitments from indistinguishable accumulators as well as a black-box construction of indistinguishable, undeniable universal accumulators from zero-knowledge sets. Latter yields the first universal accumulator construction that provides indistinguishability.},

	abstract = {Accumulators provide a way to succinctly represent a set with elements drawn from a given domain, using an {\textbackslash}emph\{accumulation value\}. Subsequently, short proofs for the set-{\textbackslash}emph\{membership\} (or {\textbackslash}emph\{non-membership\}) of any element from the domain can be constructed and efficiently verified with respect to this accumulation value. Accumulators have been widely studied in the literature, primarily, as an {\textbackslash}emph\{authentication\} primitive: a malicious prover (e.g., an untrusted server) should not be able to provide convincing proofs on false statements (e.g., successfully prove membership for a value not in the set) to a verifier that issues membership queries (of course, having no access to set itself). In essence, in existing constructions the accumulation value acts as a (honestly generated) ``commitment'' to the set that allows selective ``opening'' as specified by membership queries---but with no ``hiding'' properties. In this paper we revisit this primitive and propose a privacy-preserving enhancement. We define the notion of a {\textbackslash}emph\{zero-knowledge accumulator\} that provides the following very strong privacy notion: Accumulation values and proofs constructed during the protocol execution leak nothing about the set itself, or any subsequent updates to it (i.e., via element insertions/deletions). We formalize this property by a standard real/ideal execution game. An adversarial party that is allowed to choose the set and is given access to query and update oracles, cannot distinguish whether this interaction takes place with respect to the honestly executed algorithms of the scheme or with a simulator that is not given access to the set itself (and for updates, it does not even learn the type of update that occurred---let alone the inserted/deleted element). We compare our new privacy definition with other recently proposed similar notions showing that it is strictly stronger: We give a concrete example of the update-related information that can be leaked by previous definitions. We provide a mapping of the relations between zero-knowledge accumulators and primitives that are either set in the same security model or solve the same problem. We formally show and discuss a number of implications among primitives, some of which are not immediately evident. We believe this contribution is interesting on its own, as the area has received considerable attention recently (e.g., with the works of [Naor et al., TCC{\textasciitilde}2015] and [Derler et al., CT-RSA{\textasciitilde}2015]). We then construct the first dynamic universal zero-knowledge accumulator. Our scheme is perfect zero-knowledge and is secure under the \$q\$-Strong Bilinear Diffie-Hellman assumption. Finally, building on our dynamic universal zero-knowledge accumulator, we define a {\textbackslash}emph\{zero-knowledge authenticated set collection\} to handle more elaborate set operations (beyond set-membership). In particular, this primitive allows one to outsource a collection of sets to an untrusted server that is subsequently responsible for answering union, intersection and set difference queries over these sets issued by multiple clients. Our scheme provides proofs that are succinct and efficiently verifiable and, at the same time, leak nothing beyond the query result. In particular, it offers verification time that is asymptotically optimal (namely, the same as simply reading the answer), and proof construction that is asymptotically as efficient as existing state-of-the-art constructions--- that however, do not offer privacy.},

It has optimal communication complexity and, when combined with efficient zero-knowledge proofs, provides an ideal solution for anonymous revocation. For the construction of Braavos we use a modular approach: we show how to build an accumulator with better functionality and security from accumulators with fewer features and weaker security guarantees. We then describe an anonymous revocation component (ARC) that can be instantiated using any dynamic accumulator. ARC can be added to any anonymous system, such as anonymous credentials or group signatures, in order to equip it with a revocation functionality. Finally, we implement ARC with Braavos and plug it into Idemix, the leading implementation of anonymous credentials.

We formalize anonymous account-based cryptocurrency as a universally composable functionality and show how to efficiently instantiate it using π1-many in a straightforward way. We instantiate and implement π1-many from Strong-RSA, DDH and random oracles targeting ≈ 112 bits of security. The resulting NIZK has constant size ({\textbar}π1-many{\textbar} = 5.3 KB) and constant proving/verification time (≈ 90 ms), on an already accumulated set. Compared to ZCash---which offers comparable marginal verification cost and an anonymity set consisting of every existing transaction---our transactions are larger (6.2 KB) and verification is slower. On the other hand, Veksel relies on better studied assumptions, has no expensive trusted setup for proofs and is arguably simpler to implement. Additionally we think that π1-many might be interesting in other applications, e.g. proving possession of some credential posted on-chain. The efficiency of our concrete NIZK relies on a new Ristretto-friendly elliptic curve, Jabberwock, that is of independent interest: it can be used to efficiently prove statements on "committments on commitments'' in Bulletproofs.},

	abstract = {Veriﬁable outsourcing systems ofﬂoad a large computation to a remote server, but require that the remote server provide a succinct proof, called a SNARK, that proves that the server carried out the computation correctly. Real-world applications of this approach can be found in several blockchain systems that employ veriﬁable outsourcing to process a large number of transactions off-chain. This reduces the on-chain work to simply verifying a succinct proof that transaction processing was done correctly. In practice, veriﬁable outsourcing of state updates is done by updating the leaves of a Merkle tree, recomputing the resulting Merkle root, and proving using a SNARK that the state update was done correctly. In this work, we use a combination of existing and novel techniques to implement an RSA accumulator inside of a SNARK, and use it as a replacement for a Merkle tree. We speciﬁcally optimize the accumulator for compatibility with SNARKs. Our experiments show that the resulting system reduces costs compared to existing approaches that use Merkle trees for committing to the current state. These results apply broadly to any system that needs to ofﬂoad batches of state updates to an untrusted server.},

	abstract = {We propose an ideal functionality FCD and a construction ΠCD for oblivious and updatable committed databases. FCD allows a prover P to read, write, and update values in a database and to prove to a verifier V in zero-knowledge (ZK) that a value is read from or written into a certain position. The following properties must hold: (1) values stored in the database remain hidden from V; (2) a value read from a certain position is equal to the value previously written into that position; (3) (obliviousness) both the value read or written and its position remain hidden from V.ΠCD is based on vector commitments. After the initialization phase, the cost of read and write operations is independent of the database size, outperforming other techniques that achieve cost sublinear in the dataset size for prover and/or verifier. Therefore, our construction is especially appealing for large datasets. In existing “commit-and-prove” two-party protocols, the task of maintaining a committed database between P and V and reading and writing values into it is not separated from the task of proving statements about the values read or written. FCD allows us to improve modularity in protocol design by separating those tasks. In comparison to simply using a commitment scheme to maintain a committed database, FCD allows P to hide efficiently the positions read or written from V. Thanks to this property, we design protocols for e.g. privacy-preserving e-commerce and location-based services where V gathers aggregate statistics about the statements that P proves in ZK.},

We also provide a constant sized batch non-membership proof for a large number of elements. These proofs can be used to build the ﬁrst positional vector commitment (VC) with constant sized openings and constant sized public parameters. As a core building block for our batching techniques we develop several succinct proof systems in groups of unknown order. These extend a recent construction of a succinct proof of correct exponentiation, and include a succinct proof of knowledge of an integer discrete logarithm between two group elements. We circumvent an impossibility result for Sigma-protocols in these groups by using a short trapdoor-free CRS. We use these new accumulator and vector commitment constructions to design a stateless blockchain, where nodes only need a constant amount of storage in order to participate in consensus.

When elements are added to or deleted from the set, an update message is issued. The collection of all the update messages essentially leaks the underlying accumulated set which in certain applications is not desirable. In this work, we define oblivious accumulators, a set commitment with concise membership proofs that hides the elements and the set size from every entity: an outsider, a verifier or other element holders. We formalize this notion of privacy via two properties: element hiding and add-delete indistinguishability. We also define almost-oblivious accumulators, that only achieve a weaker notion of privacy called add-delete unlinkability. Such accumulators hide the elements but not the set size. We consider the trapdoorless, decentralized setting where different users can add and delete elements from the accumulator and compute membership proofs. We then give a generic construction of an oblivious accumulator based on key-value commitments (KVC). We also show a generic way to construct KVCs from an accumulator and a vector commitment scheme.

	abstract = {Authentication is the first, crucial step in securing digital assets like cryptocurrencies and online services like banking and social networks. It relies on principals maintaining exclusive access to credentials like cryptographic signing keys, passwords, and physical devices. But both individuals and organizations struggle to manage their credentials, resulting in loss of assets and identity theft. Multi-factor authentication improves security, but its analysis and design are mostly limited to one-shot mechanisms, which decide immediately. In this work, we study mechanisms with back-and-forth interaction with the principals. For example, a user receives an email notification about sending money from her bank account and is given a period of time to abort the operation. We formally define the authentication problem, where an authentication mechanism interacts with a user and an attacker and tries to identify the user. A mechanism's success depends on the scenario{\textasciitilde}-- whether the user / attacker know the different credentials; each credential can be safe, lost, leaked, or stolen. The profile of a mechanism is the set of all scenarios in which it succeeds. Thus, we have a partial order on mechanisms, defined by the subset relation on their profiles. We find an upper bound on the profile size and discover three types of \$n\$-credential mechanisms (for any \$n\$) that are maximally secure, meeting this bound. We show these are all the unique maximal mechanisms for \$n {\textbackslash}le 3\$. We show the efficacy of our model by analyzing existing mechanisms, both theoretical and deployed in widely-used systems, and make concrete improvement proposals.

	abstract = {An accumulator is a cryptographic primitive that allows a prover to succinctly commit to a set of values while being able to provide proofs of (non-)membership. A batch proof is an accumulator proof that can be used to prove (non-)membership of multiple values simultaneously. In this work, we present a zero-knowledge batch proof with constant proof size and constant verification in the Bilinear Pairings (BP) setting. Our scheme is 16x to 42x faster than state-of-the-art SNARK-based zero-knowledge batch proofs in the RSA setting. Additionally, we propose protocols that allow a prover to aggregate multiple individual non-membership proofs, in the BP setting, into a single batch proof of constant size. Our construction for aggregation satisfies a strong soundness definition - one where the accumulator value can be chosen arbitrarily. We evaluate our techniques and systematically compare them with RSA-based alternatives. Our evaluation results showcase several scenarios for which BP accumulators are clearly preferable and can serve as a guideline when choosing between the two types of accumulators.},

The original Nova paper (CRYPTO'22) presented Nova using a single elliptic curve group of order \$p\$. However, for improved efficiency, the implementation of Nova alters the scheme to use a 2-cycle of elliptic curves. This altered scheme is only described in the code and has not been proven secure. In this work, we point out a soundness vulnerability in the original implementation of the 2-cycle Nova system. To demonstrate this vulnerability, we construct a convincing Nova proof for the correct evaluation of \$2{\textasciicircum}\{75\}\$ rounds of the Minroot VDF in only 1.46 seconds. We then present a modification of the 2-cycle Nova system and formally prove its security. The modified system also happens to be more efficient than the original implementation. In particular, the modification eliminates an R1CS instance-witness pair from the recursive proof. The implementation of Nova has now been updated to use our optimized and secure system. We also show that Nova's IVC proofs are malleable and discuss several mitigations.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new approach to realize incrementally verifiable computation (IVC), in which the prover recursively proves the correct execution of incremental computations of the form \$y=F{\textasciicircum}\{({\textbackslash}ell)\}(x)\$, where \$F\$ is a (potentially non-deterministic) computation, \$x\$ is the input, \$y\$ is the output, and \${\textbackslash}ell {\textgreater} 0\$. Unlike prior approaches to realize IVC, our approach avoids succinct non-interactive arguments of knowledge (SNARKs) entirely and arguments of knowledge in general. Instead, we introduce and employ folding schemes, a weaker, simpler, and more efficiently-realizable primitive, which reduces the task of checking two instances in some relation to the task of checking a single instance. We construct a folding scheme for a characterization of \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{NP\}\$ and show that it implies an IVC scheme with improved efficiency characteristics: (1) the "recursion overhead" (i.e., the number of steps that the prover proves in addition to proving the execution of \$F\$) is a constant and it is dominated by two group scalar multiplications expressed as a circuit (this is the smallest recursion overhead in the literature), and (2) the prover's work at each step is dominated by two multiexponentiations of size \$O({\textbar}F{\textbar})\$, providing the fastest prover in the literature. The size of a proof is \$O({\textbar}F{\textbar})\$ group elements, but we show that using a variant of an existing zkSNARK, the prover can prove the knowledge of a valid proof succinctly and in zero-knowledge with \$O({\textbackslash}log\{{\textbar}F{\textbar}\})\$ group elements. Finally, our approach neither requires a trusted setup nor FFTs, so it can be instantiated efficiently with any cycles of elliptic curves where DLOG is hard.},

	abstract = {This paper introduces CycleFold, a new and conceptually simple approach to instantiate folding-scheme-based recursive arguments over a cycle of elliptic curves, for the purpose of realizing incrementally verifiable computation (IVC). Existing approach to solve this problem originates from BCTV (CRYPTO'14) who describe their approach for a SNARK-based recursive argument, and it was adapted by Nova (CRYPTO'22) to a folding-scheme-based recursive argument. A downside of this approach is that it represents a folding scheme verifier as a circuit on both curves in the cycle. (e.g., with Nova, this requires \${\textbackslash}approx\$10,000 multiplication gates on both curves in the cycle). CycleFold’s starting point is the observation that folding-scheme-based recursive arguments can be efficiently instantiated without a cycle of elliptic curves—except for a few scalar multiplications in their verifiers (2 in Nova, 1 in HyperNova, and 3 in ProtoStar). Accordingly, CycleFold uses the second curve in the cycle to merely represent a single scalar multiplication (\${\textbackslash}approx\$1,000--1,500 multiplication gates). CycleFold then folds invocations of that tiny circuit on the first curve in the cycle. This is nearly an order of magnitude improvement over the prior state-of-the-art in terms of circuit sizes on the second curve. CycleFold is particularly beneficial when instantiating folding-scheme-based recursive arguments over “half pairing” cycles (e.g., BN254/Grumpkin) as it keeps the circuit on the non-pairing-friendly curve minimal. The running instance in a CycleFold-based recursive argument consists of an instance on the first curve and a tiny instance on the second curve. Both instances can be proven using a zkSNARK defined over the scalar field of the first curve. On the conceptual front, with CycleFold, an IVC construction and nor its security proof has to explicitly reason about the cycle of elliptic curves. Finally, due to its simplicity, CycleFold-based recursive argument can be more easily be adapted to support parallel proving with the so-called "binary tree" IVC.},

Our construction is most efficient when instantiated in the algebraic group model (also used by Sonic), but we also demonstrate how to realize it under concrete knowledge assumptions. We implement and evaluate our construction.

	abstract = {{\textbackslash}emph\{Succinct non-interactive arguments\} (SNARGs) enable verifying NP statements with much lower complexity than required for classical NP verification (in fact, with complexity that is {\textbackslash}emph\{independent\} of the NP language at hand). In particular, SNARGs provide strong solutions to the problem of verifiably delegating computation. Despite recent progress in the understanding and construction of SNARGs, there remain unattained goals. First, {\textbackslash}emph\{publicly-verifiable SNARGs\} are only known either in the random oracle model, or in a model that allows expensive offline preprocessing. Second, known SNARGs require from the prover significantly more time or space than required for classical NP verification. We show that, assuming collision-resistant hashing, {\textbackslash}emph\{any\} SNARG having a natural {\textbackslash}emph\{proof of knowledge\} property (i.e., a SNARK) can be ``bootstrapped" to obtain a {\textbackslash}emph\{complexity-preserving\} SNARK, i.e., one without expensive preprocessing and where the prover's time and space complexity is essentially the same as that required for classical NP verification. By applying our transformation to known publicly-verifiable SNARKs with expensive preprocessing, we obtain the first publicly-verifiable complexity-preserving SNARK in the plain model (and in particular, eliminate the expensive preprocessing), thereby attaining the aforementioned goals. We also show an analogous transformation for privately-verifiable SNARKs, assuming fully-homomorphic encryption. Curiously, our transformations do not rely on PCPs. At the heart of our transformations is {\textbackslash}emph\{recursive composition\} of SNARKs and, more generally, new techniques for constructing and using {\textbackslash}emph\{proof-carrying data\} (PCD) systems, which extend the notion of a SNARK to the distributed setting. Concretely, to bootstrap a given SNARK, we recursively compose the SNARK to obtain a ``weak'' PCD system for shallow distributed computations, and then use the PCD framework to attain stronger, complexity-preserving SNARKs and PCD systems.},

The use of strong user identities makes moderation easier, but trends towards strong identity pose serious privacy issues, especially when identities are linked across social media platforms. Zero-knowledge blocklists allow cross-platform blocking of users but, counter-intuitively, do not link users identities inter- or intra-platform, or to the fact they were blocked. Unfortunately, existing approaches (Tsang et al. '10), require that servers do work linear in the size of the blocklist for each verification of a non-membership proof. We design and implement SNARKBlock, a new protocol for zero-knowledge blocklisting with server-side verification that is logarithmic in the size of the blocklist. SnarkBlock is also the first approach to support ad-hoc, federated blocklisting: websites can mix and match their own blocklists from other blocklists and dynamically choose which identity providers they trust. Our core technical advance, of separate interest, is \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{HICIAP\}\$, a zero-knowledge proof that aggregates \$n\$ Groth16 proofs into one \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$-sized proof which also shows that the input proofs share a common hidden input.Uploaded extended version},

	abstract = {We present a generalized inner product argument and demonstrate its applications to pairing-based languages. We apply our generalized argument to proving that an inner pairing product is correctly evaluated with respect to committed vectors of \$n\$ source group elements. With a structured reference string (SRS), we achieve a logarithmic-time verifier whose work is dominated by \$6 {\textbackslash}log n\$ target group exponentiations. Proofs are of size \$6 {\textbackslash}log n\$ target group elements, computed using \$6n\$ pairings and \$4n\$ exponentiations in each source group. We apply our inner product arguments to build the first polynomial commitment scheme with succinct (logarithmic) verification, \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\})\$ prover complexity for degree \$d\$ polynomials (not including the cost to evaluate the polynomial), and a CRS of size \$O({\textbackslash}sqrt\{d\})\$. Concretely, this means that for \$d=2{\textasciicircum}\{28\}\$, producing an evaluation proof in our protocol is \$76{\textbackslash}times\$ faster than doing so in the KZG commitment scheme, and the CRS in our protocol is \$1,000{\textbackslash}times\$ smaller: \$13\$MB vs \$13\$GB for KZG. This gap only grows as the degree increases. Our polynomial commitment scheme is applicable to both univariate and bivariate polynomials. As a second application, we introduce an argument for aggregating \$n\$ \${\textbackslash}mathsf\{Groth16\}\$ zkSNARKs into an \$O({\textbackslash}log n)\$ sized proof. Our protocol is significantly more efficient than aggregating these SNARKs via recursive composition (BCGMMW20): we can aggregate about \$130,000\$ proofs in \$25\$min, while in the same time recursive composition aggregates just \$90\$ proofs. Finally, we show how to apply our aggregation protocol to construct a low-memory SNARK for machine computations. For a computation that requires time \$T\$ and space \$S\$, our SNARK produces proofs in space \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(S+T)\$, which is significantly more space efficient than a monolithic SNARK, which requires space \${\textbackslash}tilde\{{\textbackslash}mathcal\{O\}\}(S {\textbackslash}cdot T)\$.Major update.

	abstract = {Blind signature is a special digital signature that allows the signer to sign a document without knowing its content. However, in many situations, multiple people need to blindly sign messages. At this time, the traditional blind signature can no longer satisfy the application requirements. To solve this problem, attribute-based cryptography has been combined with the blind signature. The concept of the attribute-based blind signature is generated. At present, all attribute-based blind signature schemes require the support of bilinear pairing technology, which involves several complex pairing and exponential operations in the signature and verification processes, and the computational efficiency is not high. In this paper, we present an attribute-based blind signature scheme based on elliptic curve cryptography (ECC), and the security of new scheme is proved under the intractability of elliptic curve discrete logarithm problem (ECDLP). Our scheme is a key policy attribute-based signature (KP-ABS). The new scheme uses linear secret sharing scheme (LSSS) matrix technology that does not require recursive operation to achieve more flexible and fine-grained access control. In addition, the scheme is based on Elliptic Curve Cryptography (ECC) using scalar multiplication on an elliptic curve instead of a bilinear pairing operation. Our scheme has significant advantages in terms of computational efficiency and storage compared with existing attribute-based blind signature schemes.},

Prior notions of blind signatures did not yield themselves to the construction of anonymous credential systems, not even if we drop the unlinkability requirement of anonymous credentials. Our new notion in contrast is a convenient building block for anonymous credential systems. The construction we propose is eﬃcient: it requires just a few exponentiations in a prime-order group in which the decisional Diﬃe-Hellman problem is hard. Thus, for the ﬁrst time, we give a provably secure construction of anonymous credentials that can work in the elliptic group setting without bilinear pairings and is based on the DDH assumption. In contrast, prior provably secure constructions were based on the RSA group or on groups with pairings, which made them prohibitively ineﬃcient for mobile devices, RFIDs and smartcards. The only prior eﬃcient construction that could work in such elliptic curve groups, due to Brands, does not have a proof of security.},

In this paper, we show how CL-signature-based anonymous credentials can be verified in smart contracts using the example of Hyperledger Indy, a decentralized credential management platform, and Ethereum, a smart contract-enabled blockchain. Therefore, we first outline how smart contract-based verification can be integrated in the Hyperledger Indy credential management routine and, then, provide a technical evaluation based on a proof-of-concept implementation of CL-signature verification on Ethereum. While our results demonstrate technical feasibility of smart contract-based verification of anonymous credentials, they also reveal technical barriers for its real-world usage.},

	abstract = {Due to the simplicity and performance of zk-SNARKs they are widely used in real-world cryptographic protocols, including blockchain and smart contract systems. Simulation Extractability (SE) is a necessary security property for a NIZK argument to achieve Universal Composability (UC), a common requirement for such protocols. Most of the works that investigated SE focus on its strong variant which implies proof non-malleability. In this work we investigate a relaxed weaker notion, that allows proof randomization, while guaranteeing statement non-malleability, which we argue to be a more natural security property. First, we show that it is already achievable by Groth16, arguably the most efficient and widely deployed SNARK nowadays. Second, we show that because of this, Groth16 can be efficiently transformed into a black-box weakly SE NIZK, which is sufficient for UC protocols. To support the second claim, we present and compare two practical constructions, both of which strike different performance trade-offs: * Int-Groth16 makes use of a known transformation that encrypts the witness inside the SNARK circuit. We instantiate this transformation with an efficient SNARK-friendly encryption scheme. * Ext-Groth16 is based on the SAVER encryption scheme (Lee et al.) that plugs the encrypted witness directly into the verification equation, externally to the circuit. We prove that Ext-Groth16 is black-box weakly SE and, contrary to Int-Groth16, that its proofs are fully randomizable.Updated from technical report to an extended version.},

	abstract = {We introduce a new notion of \{{\textbackslash}em multiverse threshold signatures\} (MTS). In an MTS scheme, multiple universes -- each defined by a set of (possibly overlapping) signers, their weights, and a specific security threshold -- can co-exist. A universe can be (adaptively) created via a non-interactive asynchronous setup. Crucially, each party in the multiverse holds constant-sized keys and releases compact signatures with size and computation time both independent of the number of universes. Given sufficient partial signatures over a message from the members of a specific universe, an aggregator can produce a short aggregate signature relative to that universe. We construct an MTS scheme building on BLS signatures. Our scheme is practical, and can be used to reduce bandwidth complexity and computational costs in decentralized oracle networks. As an example data point, consider a multiverse containing 2000 nodes and 100 universes (parameters inspired by Chainlink's use in the wild) each of which contains arbitrarily large subsets of nodes and arbitrary thresholds. Each node computes and outputs 1 group element as its partial signature; the aggregator performs under 0.7 seconds of work for each aggregate signature, and the final signature of size 192 bytes takes 6.4 ms (or 198K EVM gas units) to verify. For this setting, prior approaches when used to construct MTS, yield schemes that have one of the following drawbacks: (i) partial signatures that are 97larger, (ii) have aggregation times 311worse, or (iii) have signature size 39and verification gas costs 3.38larger. We also provide an open-source implementation and a detailed evaluation.},

	abstract = {Unlike signatures in a single-party setting, threshold signatures require cooperation among a threshold number of signers each holding a share of a common private key. Consequently, generating signatures in a threshold setting imposes overhead due to network rounds among signers, proving costly when secret shares are stored on network-limited devices or when coordination occurs over unreliable networks. In this work, we present FROST, a Flexible Round-Optimized Schnorr Threshold signature scheme that reduces network overhead during signing operations while employing a novel technique to protect against forgery attacks applicable to similar schemes in the literature. FROST improves upon the state of the art in Schnorr threshold signature protocols, as it can be safely used without limiting concurrency of signing operations yet allows for true threshold signing, as only a threshold number of participants are required for signing operations. FROST can be used as either a two-round protocol where signers send and receive two messages in total, or optimized to a single-round signing protocol with a pre-processing stage. FROST achieves its efficiency improvements in part by allowing the protocol to abort in the presence of a misbehaving participant (who is then identified and excluded from future operations)---a reasonable model for practical deployment scenarios. We present proofs of security demonstrating that FROST is secure against chosen-message attacks assuming the discrete logarithm problem is hard and the adversary controls fewer participants than the threshold.},

Unlike conventional CAs, which learn the exact identity of those registering a public key, a blind CA can simultaneously validate an identity and provide a certificate binding a public key to it, without ever learning the identity. Blind CAs would therefore allow bootstrapping truly anonymous systems in which no party ever learns who participates. In this work we focus on constructing blind CAs that can bind an email address to a public key. To do so, we first introduce secure channel injection (SCI) protocols. These allow one party (in our setting, the blind CA) to insert a private message into another party's encrypted communications. We construct an efficient SCI protocol for communications delivered over TLS, and use it to realize anonymous proofs of account ownership for SMTP servers. Combined with a zero-knowledge certificate signing protocol, we build the first blind CA that allows Alice to obtain a X.509 certificate binding her email address alice@domain.com to a public key of her choosing without ever revealing ``alice'' to the CA.

A (function hiding) functional commitment scheme enables a {\textbackslash}textit\{committer\} to commit to a secret function \$f\$ and later prove that \$y = f(x)\$ for public \$x\$ and \$y\$ without revealing any other information about \$f\$. As such, functional commitments allow the operator of a secret process to prove that the process is being applied uniformly to everyone. For example, one can commit to the secret function that computes credit scores and then prove that it is applied uniformly to all. To build a functional commitment scheme, we introduce a new primitive called a proof of function relation (PFR) to show that a committed relation is a function. We show that combining a suitable preprocessing zk-SNARK (or more precisely, an Algebraic Holographic Proof) with a PFR yields a secure functional commitment scheme. We then construct efficient PFRs for two popular preprocessing zk-SNARKs, and obtain two functional commitment schemes for arithmetic circuits. Along the way we develop new techniques for proving interesting properties of committed polynomials, which may be of independent interest.CRYPTO'22 Submission},

Our schemes are designed to reduce the size of the Bitcoin blockchain, but are useful in many other settings where multi-signatures are needed. All our constructions support both signature compression and public-key aggregation. Hence, to verify that a number of parties signed a common message m, the verifier only needs a short multi-signature, a short aggregation of their public keys, and the message m. We give new constructions that are derived from Schnorr signatures and from BLS signatures. Our constructions are in the plain public key model, meaning that users do not need to prove knowledge or possession of their secret key. In addition, we construct the first short accountable-subgroup multi-signature (ASM) scheme. An ASM scheme enables any subset S of a set of n parties to sign a message m so that a valid signature discloses which subset generated the signature (hence the subset S is accountable for signing m). We construct the first ASM scheme where signature size is only O(k) bits over the description of S, where k is the security parameter. Similarly, the aggregate public key is only O(k) bits, independent of n. The signing process is non-interactive. Our ASM scheme is very practical and well suited for compressing the data needed to spend funds from a t-of-n Multisig Bitcoin address, for any (polynomial size) t and n.},

Proactive refresh is a protocol that lets the group of signers refresh their shares of the secret key, without changing the public key or the threshold. We give several definitions for this notion achieving different levels of security. We observe that certain natural constructions for an ATS cannot be proactively refreshed because the secret key generated at setup is needed for accountability. We then construct three types of ATS schemes with proactive refresh. The first is a generic construction that is efficient when the number of signers is small. The second is a hybrid construction that performs well for a large number of signers and satisfies a strong security definition. The third is a collection of very practical constructions derived from ATS versions of the Schnorr and BLS signature schemes; however these practical constructions only satisfy our weaker notion of security.},

	abstract = {Distributed key generation (DKG) is a fundamental building block for a variety of cryptographic schemes and protocols, such as threshold cryptography, multi-party coin tossing schemes, public randomness beacons and consensus protocols. More recently, the surge in interest for blockchain technologies, and in particular the quest for developing scalable protocol designs, has renewed and strengthened the need for efficient and practical DKG schemes. Surprisingly, given the broad range of applications and available body of research, fully functional and readily available DKG protocol implementations still remain limited. This paper hereby aims to close this gap by tailoring Gennaro et al.'s well known protocol design towards being efficiently implementable within public cryptocurrency ecosystems such as Ethereum. Our theoretical improvements are supported by an open source, fully functional, well documented DKG implementation that can employ any Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) compatible smart contract platform as a communication layer. We evaluate the efficiency of our protocol and demonstrate its practicability through the deployment and successful execution of our DKG contract in the Ethereum Ropsten testnet. Given the current Ethereum block gas limit, all steps required for the key generation process, even in demanding scenarios tested with up to 256 nodes, can be verified at the smart contract level.},

	abstract = {Blind signature schemes can yield a signature and message pair whose information does not leak to the signer. However, when blind signatures are used to design e-cash schemes, there are two problems. One is the unlimited growth of the bank’s database which keeps all spent e-cashes for preventing double spending. Another problem is that the signer must assure himself that the message contains accurate information such as the face value of the e-cash without seeing it. Partially blind signatures can cope with these problems. In partially blind signatures, the signer can explicitly include some agreed common information such as the expiration date and the face value in the blind signature. Randomized signature schemes can withstand one-more-forgery under the chosen plaintext attack. Based on RSA cryptosystem FaneCheneYeh proposed a randomized blind signature scheme and ChieneJaneTseng also proposed a randomized partially blind signature scheme. But, the attacker can remove the randomizing factor from the messages to be signed in these two schemes. The attacker can also change the common information of ChieneJaneTseng’s partially blind signature. In this paper, we propose a secure randomized RSA-based partially blind signature scheme, and show that the proposed scheme satisﬁes the blindness and unforgeability properties. We also analyse the computation cost of the proposed scheme.},

In identity-based cryptography, many blind signature schemes have been proposed. Among them, Verma et al. designed an identity-based blind signature scheme with message recovery (IDBS-MR). Unfortunately, after our cryptanalysis, their scheme cannot satisfy untraceability, which enables the signer to break the anonymity of users by tracking the previous signature transmission scripts. To solve the problem, we construct a new IDBS-MR scheme using the bilinear pairing and demonstrates that the proposed scheme has blindness, untraceability, and unforgeability in the random oracle model. Performance results show that compared with Verma et al.’s scheme, the proposed scheme has the same computation costs in views of signers, twice computation costs in views of users, but reduces 36\% computation costs in views of veriﬁers.},

However, their diffusion is impaired by the lack of efﬁcient revocation techniques. Traditional credential revocation measures based on certiﬁcate revocation lists or online certiﬁcation authorities do not provide privacy and can not be used in privacy-sensitive contexts. Revocation techniques speciﬁcally geared towards anonymous credential systems exhibit involved, interactive protocols – for the credential issuer as wells as users – to update information so that users can prove that their credential is still valid, e.g., not included in a revocation list. Some techniques put additional computational burden on the credential consumers. In this paper we introduce a novel, non-interactive technique to update valid credentials. With the proposed protocol, credential issuers can update valid credentials off-line and publish a small per-credential update value on a public bulletin-board. Users can later download their values and re-validate their credentials. Our solution outperforms all prior solutions in terms of communication and computational costs for the users and credentials consumers and the issuer’s effort is comparable to the best prior proposals.},

However, it has never been examined outside of the synchronous setting, and the known DKG protocols cannot guarantee safety or liveness over the Internet. In this work, we present the first realistic DKG protocol for use over the Internet. We propose a practical system model for the Internet and define an efficient verifiable secret sharing (VSS) scheme in it. We observe the necessity of Byzantine agreement for asynchronous DKG and analyze the difficulty of using a randomized protocol for it. Using our VSS scheme and a leader-based agreement protocol, we then design a provably secure DKG protocol. We also consider and achieve cryptographic properties such as uniform randomness of the shared secret and compare static versus adaptive adversary models. Finally, we implement our DKG protocol, and establish its efficiency and reliability by extensively testing it on the PlanetLab platform. Counter to a general non-scalability perception about asynchronous systems, our experiments demonstrate that our asynchronous DKG protocol scales well with the system size and it is suitable for realizing multiparty computation and threshold cryptography over the Internet.},

Existing approaches either introduce undesirable trust assumptions or require server-side modifications. As a result, the value of users' private data is locked up in its point of origin. Users cannot export their data with preserved integrity to other applications without help and permission from the current data holder. We propose DECO (short for {\textbackslash}underline\{dec\}entralized {\textbackslash}underline\{o\}racle) to address the above problems. DECO allows users to prove that a piece of data accessed via TLS came from a particular website and optionally prove statements about such data in zero-knowledge, keeping the data itself secret. DECO is the first such system that works without trusted hardware or server-side modifications. DECO can liberate data from centralized web-service silos, making it accessible to a rich spectrum of applications. To demonstrate the power of DECO, we implement three applications that are hard to achieve without it: a private financial instrument using smart contracts, converting legacy credentials to anonymous credentials, and verifiable claims against price discrimination.},
